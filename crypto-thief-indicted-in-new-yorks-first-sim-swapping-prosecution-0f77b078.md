# Crypto Thief Indicted in New York’s First SIM Swapping Prosecution ...

Manhattan’s District Attorney (DA) announced the indictment of an individual for stealing identities and funds, including crypto, via a process known as SIM swapping.

According the Manhattan DA’s press release, the case represents the first prosecution for SIM swapping in New York.

He then successfully accessed 18 online accounts of three Manhattan residents, including their Google accounts and multiple cryptocurrency exchange accounts and changed the account’s passwords to prevent the victims from accessing them, according to the press release.

The District Attorney then also warned wireless service providers to take more precautions, asking them to:

“wake up to the new reality that by quickly porting SIMs – in order to ease new activations and provide speedy customer service – you are exposing unwitting, law-abiding customers to massive identity theft and fraud.”

SIM swapping is a kind of identity theft in which the thief routes the victim’s cellular traffic to their own phone.

Often this is done by using social engineering to convince wireless service providers to redirect the victim’s cellular data to the SIM card contained in the thief’s phone.

As Cointelegraph reported just yesterday, after stealing $5 million in cryptocurrency from 40 victims via SIM swapping, 20-year-old Joel Ortiz has pleaded guilty to theft and accepted a plea deal of 10 years in prison.
