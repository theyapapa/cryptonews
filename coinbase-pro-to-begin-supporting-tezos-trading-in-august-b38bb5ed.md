# Coinbase Pro to Begin Supporting Tezos Trading in August ...

###### 2019-07-30 17:07

Major cryptocurrency platform Coinbase is onboarding the cryptocurrency Tezos (XTZ) to its professional trading platform, Coinbase Pro.

As the company has done in the past, Coinbase Pro will ramp up to full XTZ trading in four steps: (1) transfer-only, (2) post-only, (3) limit-only, and finally (4) full trading.

## The Tezos platform

In addition to its cryptocurrency XTZ, Tezos has a platform for crypto-ledgering, which uses smart contracts and Proof of Stake voting.

As reported by Cointelegraph, the major Latin American investment bank BTG Pactual announced that it is planning to shift its security token offerings onto the Tezos blockchain and smart contracts platform.

In a recent industry move, Tezos hired a former PwC executive as the company’s CFO in June.

Tezos Foundation president Ryan Jesperson commented:

“As the foundation continues to provide resources to a growing Tezos ecosystem, the CFO and operations lead will be critical to our success.

He is already familiar with the opportunities and challenges blockchain projects face and has a deep understanding of the Tezos Foundation from his time at PwC.”
