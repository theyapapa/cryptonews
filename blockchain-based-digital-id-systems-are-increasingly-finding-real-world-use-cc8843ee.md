# Blockchain-Based Digital ID Systems Are Increasingly Finding Real-World Use ...

However, as Cointelegraph reported in an analysis last year, a growing number of blockchain-based platforms have emerged with the promise of making the data related to digital ID more manageable.

However, as encouraging as it is to see the new blockchain-based platforms actually being used, the sheer profusion of these platforms presents problems of its own, insofar as it could make it harder to arrive at the kind of universal system of digital ID the companies featured in this article are working toward, in which digital ID and personal data isn't siloed.

Other blockchain-based ID platforms have witnessed tangible growth in the past year: Civic signed partnerships with Telefonica and a number of other companies, while United Kingdom-based Nuggets recently signed a deal with Lateral Payment Solutions to bring decentralized ID to the latterâ€™s payment platform.

There is hope that blockchain-based platforms will play an increasingly important role in securing digital ID and personal data in the future.

However, since the organizations to which we have to prove our identities are growing so quickly as to stretch into almost every corner of our lives, it's clear that it's still going to take a long time before blockchain-based ID systems become widespread.

For example, there is Linum Labs' platform (recently tested by the Swiss Federal Railways), the platform now being developed by startup Attest in partnership with Deloitte, and also the Digital ID system for cross-border payments being built by Visa in collaboration with IBM.

There is, in other words, a large number of platforms offering very similar services, and the worry here is that the relative abundance of competing platforms may actually prevent a universal system of digital ID from emerging.
