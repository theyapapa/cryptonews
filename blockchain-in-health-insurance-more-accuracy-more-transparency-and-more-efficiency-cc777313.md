# Blockchain in Health Insurance: More Accuracy, More Transparency and More Efficiency ...

###### 2019-02-21 04:02

From streamlining claims processes to introducing greater transparency and enabling provider interoperability, blockchains are being increasingly sought by startups and established corporations alike as a means of pushing the industry forward, with many of the biggest names in health insurance already staking their futures on the new technology.

If there were any doubt that blockchain tech is being taken seriously by the world's biggest insurance companies, it was most likely dispelled in January, when the likes of Aetna, Anthem and Health Care Service Corporation (HCSC) announced a collaboration with IBM to build a digital ecosystem for the health care industry based on the IBM Blockchain Platform.

According to the press release, the parties involved aim to use IBM's blockchain to help with a range of industry challenges, from making the processing of claims and payments more efficient to enabling the "secure and frictionless" exchange of information among insurance providers (and medical facilities).

Similar indicators that health care insurers and providers are now serious about blockchain aren't hard to find: In August, the American advisory organization for insurers (the American Association of Insurance Services) revealed that it had launched an insurance database and reporting tool running on IBM's Hypderledger Fabric ledger.

In light of such developments, it's hard to shake the suspicion that blockchain technology will become an increasingly prominent feature of the (health) insurance industry in the coming years.

Because, as IBM's Soroush Abbaspour affirms, it offers effective ways of dealing with problems that have plagued the industry for years now:

"Blockchain technology can allow various stakeholders in the healthcare value-chain to increase transparency and streamline processes across organizations without compromising data security and integrity.

Blockchain can address a range of industry challenges, including promoting efficient claims and payment processing, enabling secure and frictionless healthcare information exchanges, and maintaining current and accurate provider directories."
