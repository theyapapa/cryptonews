# Untethered: The History of Stablecoin Tether and How It Has Lost Its $1 Peg ...

Another factor that may have influenced the drop in value of Tether was a report at the beginning of the month which stated that both Tether and Bitfinex, the exchange responsible for issuing the tokens, had parted ways with Noble Bank in Puerto Rico.

Thus, every time new Tether tokens were issued, these could be tracked on the platform, allowing the wider cryptocurrency community to keep tabs on how many new Tethers were released.

The main reason for this has been spikes in the value of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies following the periodic issuance of new Tether tokens.

The crypto community began to put pressure on the company to conduct a full audit to allay fears of inadequate cash reserves to the number of Tether tokens.

Following that, the company published a memo of a short report from Friedman LLP with the company’s accounts - in the hopes of appeasing the concerns of various parties online:

“We hope that the community considers the attached memorandum for what it is: a good faith effort on our behalf to provide an interim analysis of our cash position and our issued and outstanding tokens, as part of ongoing efforts to further professionalize the transparency mechanisms of Tether Limited.”

In the same month, a law firm in the US released a report stating the Tether did actually have the adequate reserve of fiat currency to back tokens in circulation.

In response to the report, Tether’s general counsel Stuart Hoegner told Bloomberg that mainstream accounting firms would not conduct official audits on companies working with cryptocurrencies:

“The bottom line is an audit cannot be obtained \[...\] The big four firms are anathema to that level of risk.
