# BUSD — Binance and Paxos Stablecoin Latest to Get US Regulator Consent ...

###### 2019-09-18 07:09

Over the course of the past few weeks, the global cryptocurrency community bore witness to two major announcements related to stablecoins — with the first being the launch of Paxos’s gold-backed Ethereum token, PAX Gold (PAXG), and the other being the release of Binance’s cryptocoin backed by the United States dollar (BUSD).

Paxos, a global digital asset trust firm, announced the launch of its PAXG token via a press release a few days back.

Elaborating further on the utility of PAXG, Dorothy Chang, Paxos’ vice president of marketing and communications, told Cointelegraph:

“PAX Gold stands out because we uniquely have deep experience in both the traditional gold market as well as in asset tokenization.

As mentioned previously, PAXG is an ERC-20 token that has been built on the Ethereum blockchain and is backed by physical gold, meaning it can be traded and moved anywhere around the globe with the touch of a button.

In this regard, other key facets related to PAXG that are worth highlighting include:

- The tokens are fully-backed by physical gold that is attested by a third-party auditor on a monthly basis.

The digital currency follows in the footsteps of other stablecoins — such as TrueUSD (TUSD), USDCoin (USDC) and Gemini Dollar (GUSD) — and along with PAXG, it is one of the three Paxos created digital currencies to have received a regulatory green light from the NYDFS, with the other one being Paxos Standard (PAX).

In this regard, stablecoins can essentially be thought of as crypto offerings whose prices are measured in fiat and have their value pegged to real-world assets such as the U.S. dollar, the euro, yuan or even other commodities such as oil, gold, silver and so on.
