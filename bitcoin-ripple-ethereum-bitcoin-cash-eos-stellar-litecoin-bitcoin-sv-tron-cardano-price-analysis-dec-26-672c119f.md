## BTC/USD

Bitcoin turned down from the overhead resistance of $4,255 on Dec. 24 and has broken below the 20-day EMA.

A break below the 20-day EMA and $0.33108 will weaken the pullback and plunge the digital currency back to the support line of the channel.

If the bulls bounce off the 20-day EMA and break out of $239, the digital currency will resume its recovery and can reach $262.43 and $307.01.

## XLM/USD

As the bulls could not sustain the breakout of the 20-day EMA and $0.13427050, Stellar has again dipped back below the 20-day EMA.

After the recent pullback, the TRX/USD pair might consolidate between the 20-day EMA and $0.025 for a few days.

If the 20-day EMA breaks down, the digital currency will weaken and again slide to the $0.0125 level.

Currently, the ADA/USD pair is finding support at the 20-day EMA, which is a bullish sign.
