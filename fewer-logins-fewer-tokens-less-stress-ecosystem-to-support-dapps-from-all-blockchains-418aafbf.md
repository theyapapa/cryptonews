# Fewer Logins, Fewer Tokens, Less Stress: Ecosystem to Support DApps From All Blockchains ...

###### 2019-01-03 02:01

Free products and services on the internet are a hit with the public, but a new blockchain-based ecosystem believes that most consumers are unaware of the risks of using such companies for distributing their content.

The team behind Phantasma Chain says they were motivated to act after watching the world freely share their data and content on third-party platforms, even though they run the risk of losing full control over this valuable information.

However, in a bid to end fragmentation in the crypto world, the open-source platform intends to support DApps from all blockchains – meaning that everyday users will no longer need to tie themselves to one community and instead access the “best and highest-quality apps” from each network.

## A user-friendly app

As well as offering a marketplace for non-fungible tokens from different chains, Phantasma says that another main advantage of its app is automatic conversions between coins and tokens, delivering access to a plethora of services even if a user doesn’t own the native currencies associated with each DApp.

Phantasma says a major problem facing the crypto industry right now is how users have to go through the process of heading to an exchange, fulfilling know your customer checks and converting their funds into a specific token before they can begin using a DApp.

It has already announced support for NEO and Ethereum, and the team says DApps running on EOS, TRON and other platforms will also be compatible within one single app: the Phantasma app.

Over the course of 2018, it unveiled its first dApp to developers and the public at large: PhantasmaMail, a piece of software that is designed to enable users to communicate to each other securely via its ecosystem.
