###### 2018-11-06 11:11

A Swiss company, Alprockz AG, has developed the cryptocurrency ROCKZ, and says it is the first coin paired to one of the most stable fiat currencies in the world — the Swiss Franc (CHF).

Because of this decision, it offers their new Ethereum blockchain-based platform and cryptocurrency ROCKZ (RKZ), which will be backed by the Swiss national currency, the Franc ($0.99) at the rate of 1:1.

The company has also developed a platform to exchange and store ROCKZ, and this platform supports the delivery of the coin and its fiat equivalent to the tokens’ holders.

In order to guarantee the worth of the new token with fiat money, the company says it will reserve 90 percent of its own funds in CHF, in a high-security Swiss bank storage.

Alprockz AG also promises the “absolute transparency of financial reserves” and token’s compliance with a variety of national and international legislation.

The value of each token during the public sale will be 0.6 CHF and Alprockz AG hopes to get up to CHF 12.5 million ($12.46 million) for developing the entire platform.

Alprockz AG has already agreed to work in cooperation with Swisscom and Wisekey, two companies that are already listed on the Swiss Exchange.
