Andorra Telecom has entered into partnership with Spanish digital economy-focused non-profit Alastria to integrate blockchain technology into its internal processes, Spanish-language news outlet Diari d’Andorra reported on Aug. 1.

Alastria is a consortium of over 800 non-profit organizations that launched Spain’s first national multi-sector blockchain network in a bid to facilitate the development of digital economy through blockchain.

## “To reinforce technological pillar”

Alastria will enable Andorra Telecom to deploy its blockchain network with its own node.

Jordi Nadal, director general of Andorra Telecom, said that "the agreement with Alastria allows us to reinforce the technological pillar and allows developments with different technologies, all of them of reference."

Andorra Telecom established the NIU incubator last November, with the aim to promote entrepreneurship in the field of technology.

## But education first

In February, the government of Andorra announced that it will implement blockchain technology in the country’s higher education system.

That same month, Spain’s largest multinational telecommunications company, Telefónica, announced an initiative to support entrepreneurs in innovative technologies such as blockchain and artificial intelligence.
