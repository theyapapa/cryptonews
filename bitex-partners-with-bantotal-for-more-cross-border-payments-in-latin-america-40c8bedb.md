Bitcoin (BTC) exchange Bitex has partnered with Uruguay-based financial software company Bantotal in order to expand it cross-border payments system on the Bitcoin blockchain to Latin America.

According to the report, the upshot of this partnership is that Bantotal’s clients will have access to Bitex’s exchange services via a marketplace that hosts traditional financial services in its BDevelopers program.

Per the report, Bitex will act as a middleman service for cross-border payments.

Manuel Beaudroit, the chief marketer at Bitex, explained:

“If I want to do a payment from Argentina to Chile, I don’t need to buy dollars with the Argentinian pesos then transfer the dollars to the U.S. then move the dollars to Chile and exchange them into Chilean pesos \[...\] I can just send a payment from Argentina to Chile directly.”

Bitcoin Argentina VP Leo Elduayen reportedly thinks that this partnership will majorly boost Bitex participation from within Latin America.

As stated in the report, Bitex partnered with BMV in order to allow its clients to conduct cross-border payments.

He further remarked:

“One of the initiatives is to use Bitex as a strategic partner to provide our overseas customers with payment and collection services at the Bitex Exchange.”
