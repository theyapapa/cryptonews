The Dallas Mavericks have become the second NBA team to accept Bitcoin (BTC) as a means of payment for match tickets and merchandise.

A tweet from cryptocurrency payment processor BitPay confirmed the news on Aug. 13.

## Mavs’ billionaire owner is a crypto enthusiast

Cryptocurrency adoption has been on the horizon for the Mavs since early last year, when team owner and billionaire tech investor Mark Cuban hinted that fans would soon be able to use Bitcoin to buy tickets to the team’s games.

A year and a half later, Cuban’s plans have materialized and the Mavs join their NBA rivals, The Sacramento Kings, in rolling out cryptocurrency access for their fans.

The Sacramento Kings became the first NBA team to accept Bitcoin for promotional products as well as for tickets as early as 2014.

According to an excerpt from a Dallas Mavericks press release shared by industry sources on social media, the Mavs — like The Sacramento Kings — be using BitPay’s services to process their fans’ Bitcoin payments.

Blockchain platform Socios.com has also sealed a range of partnerships with leading international soccer teams — including French club Paris Saint-Germain, Italy’s Juventus and the United Kingdom’s West Ham United — for a series of fan token offerings.
