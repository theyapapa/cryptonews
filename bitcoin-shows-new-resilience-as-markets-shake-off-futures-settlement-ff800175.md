Data from CoinMarketCap and Coin360 confirm that the end of the trading week – and with it the payment date for CME Group’s Bitcoin futures – had essentially no effect on either Bitcoin (BTC) or altcoin prices.

Elsewhere in the top twenty coins, Stellar (XLM) has seen above average movement, down 2.37 percent on the day to press time.

The total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies has seen almost no change over the past 24 hours, let alone the past week, stagnant at around $209 billion.
