Oranco, a Chinese alcohol wholesaler and marketer that specializes in Fenjiu liquor and imported wines, is currently testing a blockchain solution to guarantee the authenticity of its products.

According to a press release on July 26, Oranco subsidiary Fengyuang Huaxin Liquor Development partnered with the blockchain- focused company Guangzhou Silicon Technology (GSTC) almost one year ago.

The solution reportedly features proprietary anti-counterfeiting laser recognition, along with blockchain technology as a means to track and certify the alcohol products.

Second, GSTC will reportedly use the new blockchain solution to issue a digital ID for the product on a blockchain.

Oranco president Peng Yang believes that with this new blockchain-based assurance, the company’s products will increase in value:

“We believe the verification capabilities of blockchain will enable us to credibly assure the origins and authenticity of our premium alcoholic beverages.

## Blockchain a boon for vintners fighting fakes

A number of wine and liquor producers are also using blockchain solutions to track and demonstrate the authenticity of their products, as the market for fakes becomes a multi-billion dollar industry.

In May 2018, VeChain, a Shanghai-based blockchain startup, announced it was testing a blockchain application to verify of the wine supply chain to fight counterfeits.
