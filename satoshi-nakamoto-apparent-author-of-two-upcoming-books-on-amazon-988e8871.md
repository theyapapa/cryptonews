Two different books published under Satoshi Nakamoto’s name have recently appeared on Amazon.

According to Amazon, both of the books — Wave and Ripple Design Book and The Official Bitcoin Coloring Book — are scheduled for release on June 28.

The profile of the author makes it clear that he indeed claims to be the same Satoshi Nakamoto who created bitcoin (BTC):

“Satoshi Nakamoto is the renowned inventor of Bitcoin.”

The store descriptions of the books themselves seemingly contain inside jokes about the cryptocurrency space and the myth of Satoshi Nakamoto.

Wave and Ripple Design Book, for instance, appears to hint at both the Japanese roots of the bitcoin creator’s pseudonym, as well as to Ripple (XRP):

“A wonderful selection of wave and ripple designs curated by Satoshi Nakamoto.

The second book, The Official Bitcoin Coloring Book, contains less subtle jokes such as stating that it has been “printed on a brilliant white paper.”

At the end of May, a Chinese citizen residing in California claimed copyright to bitcoin’s white paper, claiming to be Satoshi Nakamoto.
