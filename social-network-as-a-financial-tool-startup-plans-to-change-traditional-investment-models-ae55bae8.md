# Social Network as a Financial Tool: Startup Plans to Change Traditional Investment Models ...

###### 2018-12-28 12:12

The startup aims to start a “financial revolution” by creating its own social network, where users can earn tokens and spend them by hiring top investment professionals and investing in the products and services they choose.

The idea of the Huddl project is to break the traditional investment model, in which the company says that premium products are available only for wealthy people or for institutional investors.

## Investment network

Huddl wants to give regular users access to such premium investment opportunities like commercial real estate, private banking, hedge funds, pre-IPO stocks, investment management and wealth planning.

The Huddl team offers a way to gain access to these premium investment services and products by becoming a member of Huddl’s own network.

The pools vary according to their size: from pods (the smallest unit in Huddl network) to “clusters,” which can include multiple pods with shared interests in strategies and investments.

According to the company, this system allows Huddl users to pool their money together and increase their collective buying power for gaining access to premium investment opportunities while fully controlling how their capital is managed.

“Through social clusters and collaborative idea sharing, individuals are empowered to form their own investment vehicles and have them managed by top private wealth advisors,” says Huddl Founder and CEO Stephen Corliss.
