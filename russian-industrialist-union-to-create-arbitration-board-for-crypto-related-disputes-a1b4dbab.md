# Russian Industrialist Union to Create Arbitration Board for Crypto-Related Disputes ...

The Arbitration Center at Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs (RSPP) has announced the creation of a board for disputes on issues pertaining the “digital economy,” including crypto-related cases, Kommersant reported Wednesday, Oct. 31.

Sidorenko noted that the nation’s courts are facing several challenges due to the significant growth of crypto-related cases, with almost half of them related to smart contracts:

“The courts are now facing a lot of problems, including the lack of regulatory mechanisms to protect the rights of citizens, who create and apply digital technologies, and the ability to accept digital data as a new type of evidence."

Major entrepreneurial interest in the digital economy can only be protected if the issuers of smart contracts will be civilly and legally liable for their activity, Sidorenko concludes.

According to the RSPP, the the complexity of legal issues in the blockchain and crypto space necessitates the creation of an independent body for arbitration.

RSPP, the members of which include mineral mining and smelting billionaire Vladimir Potanin, and Viktor Vekselberg, the head of the Russian innovation fund Skolkovo, has proposed an alternative to the state draft bill on crypto “On Digital Financial Assets.”

The main aim was to eliminate contradictions in the government draft and to serve the interests of Russian entrepreneurs involved in crypto-related activity.

Following recent edits to the government draft law, the legislation now lacks core crypto terms, such as a definition of crypto mining, or of cryptocurrency itself.
