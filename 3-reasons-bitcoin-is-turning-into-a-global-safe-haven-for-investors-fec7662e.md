# 3 Reasons Bitcoin Is Turning Into a Global Safe Haven for Investors ...

###### 2019-08-08 06:08

Let’s take a look why Bitcoin price is rising as a result and why investors are increasingly considering taking shelter in Bitcoin — a neutral and borderless network for storing and transferring value — alongside traditional safe haven assets.

## Every fiat currency is devaluing itself on purpose 

As the U.S. and other countries attempt to bolster economic growth through rate cuts, investors are beginning to flock to gold, cash, government bonds and increasingly Bitcoin as a hedge, according to economist, Raoul Pal.

At least seven other fiat currencies are also dropping in value, Pal notes, concluding that a strengthening dollar is catalyzing a massive global deflationary wave, which could lead to a financial crisis.

##   
Bitcoin increasingly non-correlated with traditional markets

Investors are becoming increasingly nervous as central banks have demonstrated they will continue easing.

Worth noting, India’s central bank rate appears to be in an inverse relationship with Bitcoin price over the past years, according to a chart posted by Global Macro Value Quant Expert, John M. Spallanzani.

Interestingly, rate hikes appear to coincide with Bitcoin price bottoms and vice versa over the past couple of years.

Meanwhile, Fundstrat head of research Tom Lee believes Bitcoin has decoupled from a strong dollar, which was the reason for the price slump in 2018, and “gone negative on correlation to the equity market.”
