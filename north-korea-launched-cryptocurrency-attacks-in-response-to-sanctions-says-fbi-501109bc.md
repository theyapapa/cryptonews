United States sanctions incentivized North Korea to launch cyberattacks involving cryptocurrency, a senior FBI official told a conference.

Speaking at an event organized by U.S. thinktank The Aspen Institute, Tonya Ugoretz, deputy assistant director of the FBI’s cyber division, said financial strain had driven North Korean state actors to cybercrime.

“Sanctions are having an economic impact, so cyber operations are a means to make money, whether it’s through cryptocurrency mining or bank theft,” Ugoretz said.

Erin Joe, director of the Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center under the U.S. Director of National Intelligence, concurred, stating the FBI was focusing on deterrence of crypto-related attacks.

“There is a huge effort in the FBI, and also several other entities across government, looking at ways to stop malicious activity (surrounding) cryptocurrency,” Korea Herald reported him as saying.

The debate around the true extent of cryptocurrency as a weapon for dodging political and economic sanctions continues to draw controversy.

Some sources claim that states such as Venezuela and Russia, both of which are under heavy U.S. sanctions, are involved in leveraging the technology to keep flows of wealth open in the absence of traditional financial support.
