Blockchain security firm and wallet service BitGo has announced support for Blockchain Capital’s ERC-20 token, according to a press release shared with Cointelegraph on March 19.

Blockchain Capital’s BCAP token is a security token based on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain that was launched in a $10 million initial coin offering (ICO) back in April 2017.

BCAP represents an indirect economic interest to the limited partnership interest in the tokenized investment fund, and is the world’s first security token that was sold in an ICO.

According to the recent BitGo announcement, BitGo users will now be able to hold their BCAP assets using BitGo Trust Company, a qualified and regulated custodian that provides compliant custody for security tokens.

Ben Chan, BitGo’s chief technology officer, said that qualified custodial services that are compliant with securities regulations are critical for users of the platform.

Recently, Estonian Nasdaq-powered digital trading platform DX.Exchange announced the launch of its own security token trading and security token offering (STOs) listings.

The platform reportedly allows investors to buy security tokens using both fiat and crypto such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum, Tether (USDT) and Ripple (XRP).
