International tech and IT firm Cisco Systems has opened a Co-Innovate Center in Singapore, the Bangkok Post reports on Feb. 25.

Cisco CTO Dave Ward reportedly said that the new center — there are 14 worldwide — will help stimulate the development of new technology in the region.

The branch in Singapore will purportedly concentrate on cybersecurity, the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain technology.

The IT firm will reportedly offer various prototypes and display potential applications of new technology in different commercial contexts, as well as in public administration and education.

Cisco has been actively developing blockchain technology in recent years.

In March 2018, Cisco filed a patent with the United States Patent and Trademark Office for a method of confidential group communications based on blockchain technology.

The center will conduct research on blockchain technology, showcase various applications, in addition to providing training services.
