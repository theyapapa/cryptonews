Digital assets trading and custody platform Fidelity Digital Assets has named a former Coinbase executive the head of Sales and Marketing, according to a press release published on April 10.

Christine Sandler — who previously served as head of institutional sales at American major cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase — has joined Fidelity as its head of Sales and Marketing.

Sandler’s former experience also includes Head of Equity Electronic Sales for the Americas at Barclays Investment Bank, and Executive Vice President and Global Head of Sales for NYSE Euronext.

Fidelity Digital Assets went live in the beginning of March, with a select group of clients.

Fidelity Digital Assets head Tom Jessop said at the time that the company is still working on various parts of the platform.

Earlier today, Cointelegraph reported that Mike Blandina, a former engineering executive at PayPal and Google, has joined Bitcoin (BTC) trading and custody platform Bakkt as its chief product officer.

Blandina will now lead the firm’s efforts to converge a trusted ecosystem for digital assets with payments use cases in order to help Bakkt bring real applications to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
