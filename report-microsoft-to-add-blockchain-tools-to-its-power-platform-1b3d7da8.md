American technology giant Microsoft will reportedly make blockchain-based tools available to PowerApps and Microsoft Flow users, tech-focused news outlet GeekWire reported on June 10.

Microsoft will purportedly announce its plans to add blockchain tools to its Power Platform during the Microsoft Business Applications Summit on Monday in Atlanta.

Specifically, artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain tools will be included in the company’s PowerApps custom application builder and PowerBI business intelligence tool.

The Power Platform itself is a collection of tools — Power BI, PowerApps and Microsoft Flow — designed for collaborative work to build custom apps, automate workflows to improve business productivity and analyze data for insights.

In May, the company introduced the new Azure Blockchain Development Kit for the Ethereum blockchain.

The tool kit was designed to aid developers who are building apps using Microsoft’s blockchain-as-a-service platform, Azure Blockchain Service.

As reported in late May, New York-based blockchain firm ConsenSys also released a new Blockchain and DApp Developer Job Kit to help aspiring Ethereum blockchain developers enter the market.
