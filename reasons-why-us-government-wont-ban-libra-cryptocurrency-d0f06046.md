# Reasons Why US Government Won’t Ban Libra Cryptocurrency ...

Things are heating up for Libra: This week’s United States congressional hearings showed that many politicians are not convinced by the safety aspects of Facebook’s cryptocurrency project, as they grilled the social media giant on privacy- and trust-related issues.

## Regulators’ arguments against Facebook’s Libra: privacy scandals, “broken journalism,” and “genocide”

At this point, the regulatory environment in the U.S. seems rather hostile toward Libra — even President Doland Trump has spoken against the project, saying that the social media giant’s digital currency “will have little standing or dependability.”

Indeed, just a few days before the Libra hearings, the Wall Street Journal reported that the social media giant had reached a record-breaking $5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) over repeated privacy violations — namely the 2018 Cambridge Analytica data privacy scandal, among other data breaches and leaks.

The Banking Committee hearing, which took place in Congress on July 16, showed that it will be difficult for Facebook to change regulators’ opinion toward Libra.

That, combined with remarks from other politicians, such as Rep. Waters, who have asked Facebook to halt the development of Libra “given the company’s troubled past,” seems to coincide with the arrival of a drafted bill titled “Keep Big Tech out of Finance,” allegedly deriving from within the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee.

Still, Facebook’s bad reputation with regulators and the government at large could represent a serious obstacle, says William McCormick, CEO at Pure Knot and blockchain consultant:

“Indeed the Senate hearing today highlighted that Facebook has a lot of work to do with regards AML and compliance before convincing US regulators that they have a role to play in issuing cryptocurrencies.

Consequently, as John Todaro, director of research at Tradeblock, has previously told Cointelegraph, the social media giant isn’t likely to risk entering into a conflict with the lawmakers:

“Facebook is still heavily subject to government laws and regulations around data collection, privacy, and taxation.
