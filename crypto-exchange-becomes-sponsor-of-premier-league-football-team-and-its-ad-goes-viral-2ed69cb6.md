###### 2019-03-13 14:03

A crypto exchange platform has established a sponsorship deal with an English Premier League football club and is celebrating after its 200,000th user registered with its service.

The 37-second spot, partially filmed at the Wolves’ ground at Molineux Stadium, their home for 130 years, aims to highlight the fast verification, vast payment methods, attentive support team and absolute security that CoinDeal says it offers.

## Making history

The company says it has made history by becoming the first crypto exchange to ever sponsor a Premier League team.

According to CoinDeal, its branding on the Wolves’ football kits had more than 528,000 exposures from June 1 to Nov. 30, with a gross media value of more than 18 million euros ($23.7 million).

## Dynamic and developing

CoinDeal says that, despite the recent slowdown in the crypto market, its business is “dynamically and gradually developing” — and the momentum has been buoyed further by its sponsorship of the Wolves.

In February, CoinDeal launched its Premium version for more demanding users, which offers a more extensive control panel, dedicated ticket-lines, a private channel on Telegram and faster verification.

In the near future, CoinDeal’s team plans to release its own token designed to unlock new features on its platform.
