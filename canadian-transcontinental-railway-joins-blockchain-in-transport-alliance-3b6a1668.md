Canada’s transcontinental railway, Canadian Pacific (CP), has joined the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA).

According to the announcement, CP is looking to support improvements in supply chain technology through blockchain technology.

BiTA says that by joining the group, CP is helping them to drive global supply chain interoperability.

BiTA president Patrick Duffy also commented on the potential benefits of blockchain in the transportation sector, saying that the new tech “has the potential to smooth the transactions that occur between shippers and carriers, but it requires the active participation of transportation leaders like CP."

## The Blockchain in Transport Alliance

According to the announcement, BiTA has nearly 500 member organizations in the freight, transportation, logistics and affiliated industries.

Members reportedly share a common goal of facilitating the adoption of new technology in these sectors, and work to both establish industry standards and provide education on blockchain solutions and distributed ledger technology.

## Blockchain interoperability in transportation

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, multiple companies recently conducted an international container shipment using an interoperable blockchain platform.
