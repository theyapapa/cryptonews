Blockchain development company Truffle has unveiled plans to expand its fully managed developer suite to include support for the blockchain protocols Corda, Hyperledger Fabric and Tezos.

Truffle founder and CEO Tim Coulter announced the company’s plans at TruffleCon 2019 — Truffle’s annual dev conference — on Microsoft’s campus in Redmond, Washington.

According to a press release shared with Cointelegraph, the Truffle Suite is a fully managed blockchain for dev workflow, from backend work on smart contracts to frontend creation of applications.

Truffle’s developer tools reportedly date back to 2015, when they were developed from within ConsenSys’ venture production studio.

At press time, Truffle’s developer suite supports the blockchain protocols of Ethereum and Quorum.

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the transportation group Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA) is attempting to drive supply chain interoperability through blockchain technology.

BiTA president Patrick Duffy has commented on the group’s goals, noting that blockchain “has the potential to smooth the transactions that occur between shippers and carriers, but it requires the active participation of transportation leaders.”
