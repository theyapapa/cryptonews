## Altcoins rise from the dead (at last)

Altcoin investors also had something to talk about this week as Bitcoin’s gains contributed to a recovery from previous lows.

As Cointelegraph reported, markets saw a considerable decline last week, with some altcoins dropping to lows against Bitcoin not seen for years.

Ether (ETH), the largest altcoin asset by market cap, gained 8.3% to hit $200 once again, some way to previous levels of $225 seen before its latest decline.

Other tokens in the top ten followed suit, with Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Litecoin (LTC) and XRP producing gains of between 6% and 8% on the day.

The uptick had a telling effect on the overall cryptocurrency market cap, which on Monday stood at just under $280 billion, Bitcoin’s share challenging 69%.
