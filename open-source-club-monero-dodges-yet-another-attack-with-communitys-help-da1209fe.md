# Open-Source Club: Monero Dodges Yet Another Attack With Community’s Help ...

###### 2018-09-28 12:09

This week, the developers of Monero (XMR) patched a bug that could allow an attacker to ‘burn’ the funds of an organization’s wallet.

## Anonymity above all: How Monero works

Simply put, Monero (XMR) is a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin (BTC), but with an additional focus on anonymity.

XMR has considerably more privacy properties than BTC: Instead of just being a decentralized coin, Monero is designed to be fully anonymous and virtually untraceable.

Interestingly, while Europol’s latest cybercrime report suggests that BTC remains the most popular cryptocurrency for criminal activities, it also predicts a rise in the demand for anonymity-focused altcoins, including Monero (XMR).

## The burning bug: Potential threat to Monero’s ecosystem

On Sept. 18, user u/s\_c\_m\_l described a hypothetical attack within the XMR ecosystem on the Monero official subreddit:

“I can imagine an attack where ‘A’ procures \[a\] large amount of XMR and \[sends\] it to ‘Exchange B’ in many transactions with the same stealth address.

Importantly, the Monero blockchain ‘burns’ XMR transactions between identical stealth addresses, seeing them as illegitimate.

Soon, it became clear that the attack didn’t center around Monero specifically, as the malicious code was reportedly activated on websites such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft, GitHub and MyEtherWallet along with Monero XMR web wallet services.Array
