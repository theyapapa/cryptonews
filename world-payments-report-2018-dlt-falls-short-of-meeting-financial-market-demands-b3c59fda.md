# World Payments Report 2018: DLT Falls Short of Meeting Financial Market Demands ...

The World Payments Report 2018 published Oct. 16 has found that distributed ledger technology (DLT) is not currently capable of meeting financial market demands.

To prepare the report, researchers conducted an assessment based on multiple criteria, including industry governance, market dynamics, demographics, and enabling infrastructure.

In the report, the authors address challenges facing DLT adoption.

“Multiple DLT systems create a fragmented market with limited connectivity between solutions, which leads to inefficiencies and limited adoption,” the report further reads.

Per the report, the legal risk for DLT is represented by an uncertain regulatory environment and a lack of legal frameworks in most countries.

The report cites a three-year experimentation with DLT by De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB), saying that “in its current state it \[DLT\] fails to meet the very high demands of a financial market infrastructure.”

DNB, however, further states that DLT could replace some market infrastructures, including interbank settlements and cross-currency transactions.
