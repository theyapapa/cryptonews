###### 2018-11-02 18:11

Major U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has announced it is accepting inbound transfers of Basic Attention Token (BAT) to Coinbase Pro, according to a blog post published Nov. 2.

Coinbase added support for BAT tokens on its Coinbase Pro platform, while it will enable trading on the BAT/USD order book only when sufficient liquidity is established.

Coinbase notes that BAT trading will be available in most jurisdictions, except for residents of the state of New York.

BAT is not currently available on the exchange’s platform Coinbase.com and in its iOS and Android applications.

Per the post, the BAT trading will go through four stages, including “transfer-only,” where users will be able to transfer BAT into Coinbase Pro accounts, “post-only,” which will enable customers to post limit orders.

BAT is an Ethereum-based token integrated with the blockchain-powered privacy-focused web browser Brave.

In October, Coinbase launched trading for 0x (ZRX), making it the first ERC-20 token available for trade on the platform.
