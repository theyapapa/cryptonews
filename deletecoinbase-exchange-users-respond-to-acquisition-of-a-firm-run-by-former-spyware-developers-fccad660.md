# \#DeleteCoinbase: Exchange Users Respond to Acquisition of a Firm Run by Former Spyware Developers ...

Last week, Coinbase announced that it had acquired Neutrino, a blockchain intelligence startup, which at first seemed like a regular purchase for the ever-growing United States cryptocurrency exchange.

However, soon the crypto community learned that Neurino’s key staff are directly affiliated with Hacking Team, a controversial information technology outfit that sells offensive surveillance capabilities to governments, law enforcement agencies and corporations across the world.

## Neutrino’s key staff have been involved with Hacking Team, the Italy-based controversial outfit

On Feb. 19, Coinbase reported acquiring the Italy-based firm Neutrino to improve safety and boost its Anti Money-Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) measures.

## Community and Coinbase reaction

Soon after Coinbase announced its acquisition, crypto community members started to point out that Neutrino was founded by Hacking Team’s former employees.

For instance, Amber Baldet, co-founder and CEO of the startup Clovyr and former lead at JPMorgan Chase's Blockchain Center of Excellence (BCOE), tweeted:

“When I said it would be great to have more infosec people involved in the ‘crypto’ space, I didn’t mean the largest US exchange should acquire an analysis tools company run by a former Hacking Team member, but here we are.”

By Feb. 26, the exchange’s spokesperson told Motherboard that his firm “does not condone nor will it defend the actions of Hacking Team,” adding:

“We are aware that Neutrino’s co-founders previously worked at Hacking Team, which we reviewed as part of our security, technical, and hiring diligence.”

The Coinbase representative further explained that Neutrino’s technology basically seemed too good to be ignored:

“Increasingly, third-party blockchain analysis companies are requesting customer data from cryptocurrency companies that they serve.
