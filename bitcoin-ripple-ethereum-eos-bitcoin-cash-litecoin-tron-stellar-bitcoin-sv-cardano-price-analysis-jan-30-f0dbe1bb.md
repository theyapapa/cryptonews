Conversely, if the price turns down from either one of the overhead resistances, the BTC/USD pair will again drop to the support at $3,236.09.

If the bulls push the price above the 20-day EMA, the XRP/USD pair can rally to the 50-day SMA.

It held the support at the 20-day EMA for the past two days and is now attempting to break out of the overhead resistance at $0.02815521 once again.

However, if the price turns down from the breakdown level of $0.09285498, the cryptocurrency can slump to $0.07864971, and further to $0.05795397.

## BSV/USD

The bulls have been trying to hold the support at $65.031 for the past two days.

## ADA/USD

Although Cardano (ADA) broke below the support line of the ascending channel on Jan. 29, the bulls are trying to defend the next support at $0.036815.

If the price bounces from the current level, it can move up to the 20-day EMA, which will act as a resistance.
