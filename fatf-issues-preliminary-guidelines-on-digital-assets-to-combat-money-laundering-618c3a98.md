The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an intergovernmental organization that develops policies against money laundering, has published preliminary guidelines for cryptocurrencies on its website on Thursday, Feb. 28.

According to the organization, the new text of the Interpretive Note to Recommendation 15 — which contains requirements for regulating and supervising digital asset services providers — has been finalized.

Firstly, the task force urges countries to follow guidelines to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing with cryptocurrencies — an amendment from a previous edition signed in 2018.

The FATF also adds that crypto products must sometimes be certified, should the host country requires it.

The FATF emphasizes that monitoring must be conducted by a competent authority instead of a self-regulatory body in order to successfully prevent money laundering and terrorism financing.

Finally, the FATF obliges digital asset providers to obtain and keep records of senders and beneficiaries of crypto transfers, and to provide the data to appropriate state or international authorities should they require it.

The FATF currently has over 30 member countries.
