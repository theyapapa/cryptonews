Mike Novogratz, an ex-Goldman Sachs partner and founder of crypto merchant bank Galaxy Digital, said that he does not expect the Bitcoin (BTC) price to decline much further in an interview published by Bloomberg on Dec. 18.

Speaking on Bloomberg Television, Novogratz opined that there will not be much further decline in the Bitcoin price, despite the recent slump in the market.

Novogratz projected that the Bitcoin price will stay between $3,000 and $6,000 in the foreseeable future.

Novogratz continued, saying that the macro trading environment has become more interesting than the digital assets market:

"We are entering a cool era for macro.

Earlier in December, Novogratz compared cryptocurrency market performance to a “methadone clinic.”

In November, Novogratz said that he expects cryptocurrency to “flip next year” since “that’s when prices start moving again.”

Novogratz predicted that financial institutions will transition from “investing in cryptocurrency funds to investing in cryptocurrencies proper in the first quarter of next year.”
