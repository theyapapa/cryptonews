Along with Facebook’s crypto project, the markets are also eagerly awaiting the launch of TON, the blockchain platform being developed by messaging app Telegram.

The price has sustained above 20-week EMA for the past three weeks and the RSI has rallied into the positive territory, which shows that bulls are in command.

If the pair turns down from the current levels or from $140.3450, the bulls will try to defend the support line of the ascending channel.

The uptrend will weaken and our bullish projections will be negated if the bears sink the cryptocurrency below the support line of the channel.

Some of the critical news and events that might be helping the rise are the upcoming testing of futures trading on the Bakkt platform, the end of the bear market, the ongoing trade war between China and the U.S., the reported launch of Facebook’s own stablecoin, etc.

If the bulls push the price above $307.67, it is likely to start a new uptrend that can carry the pair to $500, which is likely to act as a stiff resistance.

Our bullish assumption will prove to be wrong if the bears defend the overhead resistance zone of $280 to $307.67 and sink the cryptocurrency below the moving averages.
