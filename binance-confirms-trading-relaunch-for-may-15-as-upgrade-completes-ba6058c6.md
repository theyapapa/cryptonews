Cryptocurrency exchange Binance has confirmed it has completed a major system upgrade and will relaunch its trading platform at 13:00 UTC on May 15.

Now, Binance is preparing to open up full its previous suite of trading features, including deposits and withdrawals, for all users.

“Binance has completed its system upgrade and we will resume all trading activity at 1:00 PM (UTC),” a new statement reads.

It states:

“From now until the commencement of trading, users will be able to cancel open orders, process deposits and use other account related functions.

Binance’s hack caught the cryptocurrency community by surprise when it emerged $41 million of funds had gone missing from some user accounts.

Binance admitted liability for the attack, on Tuesday urging users to read and comply with a list of 14 security precautions to protect funds on the exchange.

As a form of compensation to users unable to use their accounts as normal, Binance also announced a giveaway scheme involving its in-house token, binance coin (BNB).
