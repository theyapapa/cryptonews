Major global securities marketplace Deutsche Börse has reported it is “making significant progress” on its blockchain-based securities lending platform, according to an official press release on Jan. 29.

The platform is being co-developed by the German securities marketplace and Luxembourg-based blockchain liquidity management platform, HQLAx.

According to the press release from Deutsche Börse, six banks have to date confirmed their plans to join the ​​securities lending platform, and have initiated “their connectivity processes.”

Deutsche Börse first announced its plans to develop a blockchain-enabled securities lending tool in partnership with HQLAx in March 2018.

Based on enterprise blockchain consortium R3’s Corda blockchain platform, the tool is designed to improve the process of “collateral management of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA).”

Jens Hachmeister, Deutsche Börse’s head of blockchain initiatives, stressed that the technology particularly increases efficiency in securities financing.

Recently, Dutch multinational bank ING signed an agreement with R3 in order to have an unlimited number of licenses for R3’s Corda Enterprise platform.
