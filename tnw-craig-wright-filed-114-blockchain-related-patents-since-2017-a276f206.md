Craig Wright, an Australian computer scientist who has sometimes claimed to be Bitcoin (BTC) creator Satoshi Nakamoto, has reportedly applied for a slew of blockchain-related patents since 2017.

Tech news site The Next Web (TNW) published its research regarding Wright’s patent filings on March 18.

TNW reports that, since August 2017, the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) has published 155 patent applications filed by Wright.

Wright will only receive proprietary control over the patents’ contents if they are formally awarded by the WIPO.

Some have argued that Wright is a “patent troll” who is attempting to amass blockchain-related patents not to use them, but to extract rents from companies that want to apply the technology.

Last year, Wright was sued for $4 billion when the estate of David Kleiman — a computer scientist and cyber-security expert, whom many suspect to have been one of the developers behind Bitcoin and blockchain tech — claimed that Wright stole billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin.

According to the plaintiffs, Wright recognized that the family were unaware of Kleiman’s wealth and “forged a series of contracts that purported to transfer Dave’s assets to Craig and/or companies controlled by him.
