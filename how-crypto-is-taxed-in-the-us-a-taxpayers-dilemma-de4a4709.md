## A taxpayer’s dilemma

Let's imagine a potential 2019 taxpayer sitting in front of his tax advisor and feeling embarrassed to tell him that he had lost 90 percent of a 100K investment in cryptocurrencies when the cryptocurrency markets experienced a downturn during 2018, with leading cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) down 80 percent or more.

The tax advisor assured the taxpayer that this would give rise to a taxable event only if he sold, exchanged or donated his cryptocurrency during 2018, and that these things would need to be reported on his U.S. tax return — noting, however, that holding cryptocurrencies would not give rise to a taxable event but may give rise to tax-reporting requirements if the cryptocurrencies were held in a foreign financial account.

Tax-reporting requirements would arise if the taxpayer held these cryptocurrencies in a foreign financial account and if mandatory financial thresholds were met under Foreign Bank Account Report (FBAR) and Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) reporting requirements, according to a letter from the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

Specific information should be given in Part V. Noncompliance with FATCA could subject a taxpayer to taxes, severe penalties in excess of the unreported foreign assets, and exclusion from access to U.S. markets, which could include a regulated cryptocurrency derivatives clearing market.

The donation will be tax deductible for the U.S. individual donor as follows:

- If the donor held the cryptocurrency as a capital asset for more than a year, the donor will be able to deduct the fair market value of the gift up to 30 percent of their adjusted gross income (AGI).

A taxpayer can use his cryptocurrency investment capital losses to offset gains and deduct the difference on his tax return, up to $3,000 per year.

However, taxpayers who have neglected to pay their cryptocurrency-related U.S. taxes and who file their applicable U.S. tax returns should do so by April 15, 2019 to avoid interest, penalties, and even jail time for tax evasion or, worse, for tax fraud, since “cryptocurrencies are a key part of the Joint Chiefs of Global Tax Enforcement’s work,” Don Fort, chief of the Criminal Investigation Department at the IRS said at a Joint Chiefs of Global Tax Enforcement meeting in Amsterdam, citing the risk that such coins are used in the U.S. to avoid paying taxes.
