Binance Labs, the venture wing of the largest cryptocurrency exchange Binance, has released its first “batch” of blockchain projects from its Incubation Program, according to a press release shared with Cointelegraph on Dec. 14.

Binance Labs is an initiative that seeks to help early-stage blockchain and digital assets projects and entrepreneurs through direct investments and technical assistance.

The Binance Labs Incubation Program is an onsite program that was launched in August 2018.

Following a try-out tour with over 500 applicants, Binance Labs selected only eight projects, each of which received $500,000 in seed funding and access to necessary resources and mentors.

Among others, the eight projects selected by Binance Labs include hardware wallet SafePal, fictionless logins for decentralized apps (DApps) Torus, Internet security project Nym, and market prediction startup Deaux.

In the beginning of October, Binance Labs reportedly invested millions of dollars in decentralized digital content ecosystem Contentos.

Last month, Binance launched an analysis division Binance Research to conduct “institutional-grade” research reports.
