# Ron Paul: ‘I’m All for Cryptocurrencies, I Like Competing Currencies’ ...

Former Republican congressman and presidential candidate Ron Paul says he is in favor of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology because he likes competing currencies.

According to Paul, cryptocurrencies are a great idea, and governments should only step in to regulate the space to prevent fraud:

“… I’m for the least amount of regulation.

Ron Paul also drew several comparisons to the traditional asset gold.

One way in which Paul appears to think gold is similar to crypto is that both are assets competing with fiat money.

Paul said, “governments aren’t very tolerant of competition, and they’re not even tolerant with using the Constitution to compete with the fiat dollar.

Ron Paul has previously discussed his bullish views on cryptocurrency.

In 2014, Paul expressed concerns about the backing of Bitcoin (BTC) and crypto in general, but adopted a pro-crypto attitude that is bearish on fiat money in the long run:

“I just don’t think the dollar is going to last.
