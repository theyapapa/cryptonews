South Africa’s national cricket organization briefly fell victim to scammers on Twitter and began offering a fake Bitcoin (BTC) lottery, Indian daily news outlet Indian Express reported on Jan. 14.

Staff claimed the organization had begun a partnership with Luno, a United Kingdom-based cryptocurrency wallet, through which users could win a prize worth 20 BTC ($70,900).

The now-deleted tweet included a Bitcoin address to which those wishing to be involved should send a 0.01 BTC, and was active for around five hours.

“Apologies to all our Twitter followers who were affected by the hack overnight,” CSA subsequently wrote in a follow-up tweet after confirming their Twitter was back under their control.

At press time, a separate tweet from PPC Newlands Cricket about the fake BTC giveaway from CSA was still live.

The Bitcoin address used in the rogue lottery contained a balance of 0.02 BTC ($70) at press time, suggesting only two Twitter users sent funds.

As Cointelegraph reported, well-known figures such as Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin have voiced concern about the problem, which includes mass armies of bots and fake accounts penning tweets about fake giveaways.
