Mike Novogratz, ex-Goldman Sachs partner and founder of Galaxy Digital, has said that he expects cryptocurrency to “flip next year” in an interview published by Financial Times (FT) Nov. 23.

During the interview, Novogratz said that “this year has been challenging” for Galaxy Digital – a company that he hopes will become “the Goldman Sachs of crypto” – adding that “it sucks to build a business in a bear market.”

According to FT, Novogratz predicted that financial institutions will transition from “investing in cryptocurrency funds to investing in cryptocurrencies proper in the first quarter of next year.”

As FT reports, Novogratz also predicted that cryptocurrencies will “flip next year” since “that’s when prices start moving again.”

FT also quoted Tim Swanson, founder of fintech advisory firm Post Oak Labs, saying that Novogratz was “trying to predict something that he has no influence over” whenever he says “something is going to happen with price.”

The article also quotes an anonymous founder of a blockchain company saying that “one of the biggest problems in crypto is the lack of credible merchant banking” and that Galaxy Digital is “well placed to be the first to take advantage of new markets.”

According to FT, Novogratz said that “it’s easy to get sceptical but there’s something happening” after having pointed out cryptocurrency developments led by major figures in traditional finance.
