Taiwan-based tech giant ASUS has partnered with GPU mining platform Quantumcloud to allow users to mine crypto via their graphic cards, multinational tech media TechRadar reported Thursday, Nov. 30.

According to the agreement, ASUS graphic cards owners will be able to mine crypto through Quantumcloud software and withdraw earnings using PayPal or Chinese app WeChat.

Earlier in November, ASUS teamed up with California-based semiconductor supplier AMD and other major tech companies to produce eight new crypto mining rigs.

In July, Cointelegraph reported that GPU prices were declining along with sinking prices in crypto markets.

Other GPU manufacturers like Nvidia have been negatively affected by the current bear market.

When the firm announced its Q3 results earlier this month, it revealed a “crypto hangover” due to disappearing sales to crypto miners.

Meanwhile, major crypto mining firms in China have reportedly started selling off their mining hardware by weight, following a recent collapse of crypto markets that began in mid-November.
