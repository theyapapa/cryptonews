Major United States-based crypto exchange and wallet provider Coinbase has appointed Dan Yoo as its new vice president, industry-focused media outlet Coindesk reported on Sept. 10.

At Coinbase, Yoo will be replacing Emilie Choi, previously vice president of business, data and international promoted to its chief operating officer at the company.

Yoo will work on Coinbase’s business operations, business and corporate development and the data team.

## “Not a crypto expert”

Commenting on the appointment, Yoo ostensibly said: “Coinbase is a very data-driven company.

Prior to joining Coinbase, Yoo worked for professional social network LinkedIn, life insurance firm ReliaQuote, as well as set up a number of startups.

## Departures from Coinbase

In July, news broke that Tim Wagner, the vice president of engineering at Coinbase, was reportedly leaving the company.

That same month, Andrew L. Ridenour — who worked at Coinbase for just half a year longer than Wagner — left the crypto company to rejoin the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
