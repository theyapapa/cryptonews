Calgary, a city in the Canadian province of Alberta, has launched its own digital currency.

The Calgary Dollar will allow holders to pay for services and goods at local shops, Canadian major media outlet Global News reports Friday, Dec. 7.

According to HuffPost Canada, the Calgary dollar was initially launched in 1996, with citizens and businesses offering goods and services in exchange for the local currency alongside the Canadian dollar.

One way to obtain the currency is by posting ads for goods and services that users want to sell in the app or on projectâ€™s website for Calgary dollars, receiving a small amount of the digital currency in exchange for posting the ad.

Moreover, the Victoria Park, an events and culture district of Calgary, is reportedly offering cash back to shoppers who use the local digital currency.

Local entrepreneurs, in their turn, can pay up to half of their business licenses with Calgary dollars.

Meanwhile, in Dubai, consumers will soon be able to use digital currency to pay for goods, services and utilities following a new government partnership with a blockchain payment provider.
