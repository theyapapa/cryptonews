The Port Authority of Valencia (PAV), Spain, has integrated into the TradeLens platform, a blockchain ecosystem jointly developed by IBM and shipping giant Maersk, according to an official announcement published Nov. 5.

Launched in August 2018, the TradeLens platform applies blockchain technology to global supply chains.

The product aims to improve trade efficiency and security, wherein all participants of the supply chain, including shipping lines, port and terminal operators, customs authorities and other parties, can interact and access shipping data and documents.

The PAV initially announced its plans to create a “smart port” based on blockchain and big data technologies in the beginning of October.

Jose Garcia De La Guia, who is responsible for implementing new technologies in the PAV suggested that blockchain could improve logistics on a global scale and help create "ports without papers" and reduce the time spent on maintenance.

Other ports have also made moves to integrate blockchain technology into their operations.

The members of the blockchain trial expect that the technology will help reduce shipping time and simplify financial transactions.
