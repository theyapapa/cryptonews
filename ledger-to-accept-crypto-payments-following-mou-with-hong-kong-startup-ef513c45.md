Crypto hardware wallet supplier Ledger has signed an agreement with crypto payment startup Crypto.com to allow users to pay for its products with crypto, according to a press release shared with Cointelegraph on Dec. 19.

Hong Kong-based Crypto.com has reportedly signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Ledger that will enable Ledger to adopt their service Crypto.com Pay.

The payment platform will purportedly allow Ledger clients to pay for products with cryptocurrency.

Crypto.com Pay will purportedly be incorporated into Ledger’s online store, where customers will able to make purchases via Crypto.com Wallet and Card application.

While the press release does not specify which cryptocurrencies will be supported by the new payment solution, Crypto.com’s Wallet features seven fiat currencies and six cryptocurrencies, according to their website.

Ledger CEO Éric Larchevêque stated that introducing a crypto payment option for products purchases is a “natural step,” and this payment method is “just what \[Ledger\] customers are seeking.”

In November, Ledger added support for privacy-focused altcoin Monero (XMR) to its Nano S wallet device, having previously resumed support for Bitcoin Cash (BCH), following a suspension of service in mid-November.
