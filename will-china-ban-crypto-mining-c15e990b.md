# Will China Ban Crypto Mining? ...

###### 2019-04-12 03:04

Given that China has been hosting the majority of mining pools on its soil, the global crypto industry might be poised to take a massive hit.

In February 2018, CNN Money reported that the Chinese government pushed crypto miners to make an "orderly exit" from the industry due to tax issues and mining being generally dangerous for the environment.

## New plans: NDRC to dismiss mining as an eco-unfriendly activity

Now, China's central state planning agency, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), has revealed it might curb crypto mining in the country altogether.

As local newspaper South China Morning Post reported, the new plan brings uncertainty not only to local miners, but to the makers of cryptocurrency mining rigs as well.

He went on to say:

“There will certainly be many winners and losers in the mining industry, as non-Chinese miners would benefit in the short term from significantly reduced difficulty, and from inexpensive surplus hardware as it filters out of China.”

If the ban does come through, however, part of the mining economy could move underground, but the overall scope of mining operations won’t be the same for China, which might be dethroned by other countries in that case, D’Aria said:

“It \[cryptocurrency mining in China\] can continue at a very small scale — a basement here, a shed there, etc.

For instance, Dovey Wan, founding partner at blockchain-focused Primitive Ventures, pointed out that the NDRC’s purview in regard to the industries it wants to eliminate seems limited:

there is another version of such proposal published in 2011 https://t.co/BY2unufFbd  
  
Obviously many stuff should be “eliminated” in the 2011 version reappear in the 2019 version 🙃🙃🙃 such proposal in China usually is just “proposal”

— Dovey Wan 🦖 (@DoveyWan) April 9, 2019A similar viewpoint was expressed by an independent crypto industry analyst Katherine Wu, who told Wired that this clampdown seems to be more indirect compared to previous crypto regulations in the country, and many industries on the commission’s list of wasteful activities are still far from what’s described under “immediate elimination.”
