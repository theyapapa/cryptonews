# Report: No Bank Account Needed to Transfer China’s Upcoming CBDC ...

###### 2019-08-29 20:08

Binance Research, the research arm of the major crypto platform Binance, has reported that no bank account will be necessary to use China’s Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC).

According to the report, China’s CBDC will be transferable without a bank due to its loosely coupled design.

The upshot is that users will reportedly be able to transfer the CBDC to one another without needing a bank account.

The goals of this design are to provide a degree of user anonymity, promote a CBDC turnover rate equivalent to that of cash and to boost the circulation and internationalization of the renminbi.

The report also puts forward that the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) is considering utilizing smart contracts in their infrastructure, but is hesitant to implement anything that would extend beyond “basic monetary requirements” — a term that has yet to be defined.

According to the report, the PBoC is concerned that if they implement smart contracts that add some sort of value to the CBDC, its offering would become a security instead.

## No plans to launch in November

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, The Global Times claimed that the PBoC had no plans to release its CBDC in November.
