## Samsung readies new ETH-based blockchain mainnet and cryptocurrency token

On Wednesday (April 24, 2019), an inside source within Samsung revealed that the company’s blockchain division was developing an Ethereum-based blockchain mainnet.

Samsung Coin could be used as a payment token within the company’s payment app, Samsung Pay.

## Facebook making another play at a payment system

Back in December 2018, Cointelegraph began reporting that Facebook, the largest social media platform in the world, was looking to launch its own in-app virtual currency.
