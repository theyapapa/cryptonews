# Crypto Investor Names Primary Suspect in $24 Million SIM Swapping Case ...

As reported, plaintiff Michael Terpin — a long-time blockchain and crypto investor — first filed a lawsuit against AT&T last August, accusing the firm of negligence that allegedly allowed the suspect to gain control over Terpin’s phone number and steal almost $24 million worth of crypto.

According to Terpin's declaration, which was filed with the United States District Court in Los Angeles on Dec. 31, 2018, Terpin and his legal team allege they have identified the primary suspect who initiated the SIM swap — 21-year old New Yorker Nicholas Truglia.

According to Terpin’s lawsuit against Truglia, filed Dec. 28, 2018, Truglia is currently incarcerated in Santa Clara County, California, in connection with this prior case.

The lawsuit alleges that Truglia, alongside a host of alleged accomplices, perpetrated the SIM swap against Terpin on Jan. 7 and Jan. 8, 2018, resulting in crypto losses estimated to be worth $23.8 million.

Amongst the evidence presented in the lawsuit are statements and text messages purportedly sent by Truglia on the date of the Terpin SIM swap, in which he is alleged to have explicitly told friends that he had stolen a cryptocurrency wallet with holdings worth $20 million.

Terpin’s complaint notably includes charges against Truglia and his alleged accomplices under the The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act , which seeks penalties for the perpetration of repeated, organized criminal acts committed through mutual assistance, as part of a criminal organization.

Terpin was moreover immediately granted a writ of attachment against up to $24 million of Truglia's assets on the date of the lawsuit’s filing.
