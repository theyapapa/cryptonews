On April 6, Tron founder and CEO Justin Sun had taken part in The Crypto Chick podcast, hinting that the Tron ecosystem will officially collaborate with Ethereum (ETH) later this year without providing any further details.

During the same podcast, Sun said that the Tron-based version of stablecoin Tether (USDT) is set to launch on April 9.

Earlier in April, the Tron Foundation had decided ask developers to remove gambling DApps from the Japanese market in order to comply with local regulations.
