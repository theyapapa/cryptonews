# Token Trading Volumes ‘Plummet’ on Major Exchanges, Diar Report Says ...

###### 2018-11-26 16:11

A new report from weekly crypto outlet Diar published Nov. 26 states that trading volumes on major exchanges have dropped substantially.

Diar’s data, sampled from across eight leading crypto exchanges — Binance, OKex, Huobi, Bitfinex, Kraken, Poloniex, Bittrex, HitBTC — reveals that 60 percent of cryptocurrencies that continue to be listed as of Jan. 2018 are now trading at lower volumes than at the start of the year.

Over 20 percent of these have experienced an extraordinary drop, today seeing less than 90 percent of the trading volumes they saw during the crypto market bull run this January.

While 410 tokens have seen an overall increase in volume this year, the number of these that have seen an increase of over 100 percent dropped from 102 to 91 between October and November alone.

As the report shows in more detail, Diar’s liquidity data varies significantly when it is broken down by crypto exchange: on Poloniex, all listen tokens have lower trading volumes compared to the start of the year.

Diar continues:

“The outliers, by reported volume at least, are OKEx and Huobi, with Binance having a fairly equal share of trading volumes across the percentage bands.

In an interview earlier this month, Changpeng Zhao, CEO of the world’s largest crypto exchange Binance, said the company was “not worried” by declining trade volumes.
