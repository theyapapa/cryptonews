U.S. tech giant IBM has officially launched its blockchain-based food tracking network, Food Trust, after 18 months of testing, the company revealed in a press-release Monday, October 8.

As IBM’s press release reports, by 2022 Carrefour is planning to expand blockchain to all of its brands around the world.

IBM Food Trust was first announced back in 2016 as a blockchain solution that would connect different parties in the food industry.

According to IBM, during its testing period, that retailers and suppliers used the Food Trust blockchain to track “millions of individual food products.”

U.S. retail corporation Walmart was one of the first to companies to join IBM in experimenting in the area, back in 2016 using blockchain to identify and remove recalled foods that customers had complained about.

Just last month, Walmart announced it would be asking leafy greens suppliers to implement a farm-to-store tracking system based on IBM’s Food Trust system.

For IBM, the food industry is only one of many forays into blockchain tech.
