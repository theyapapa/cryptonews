United Arab Emirates-based cryptocurrency exchange BitOasis has reportedly secured preliminary approval with financial regulators, Bloomberg reported on May 13.

Founded in 2015, BitOasis claims to be the Middle East's first digital currency wallet that uses multi-signature technology.

The company previously announced that it was seeking to be fully licensed in the financial center Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) before the end of this year.

Today, Bloomberg reported that BitOasis received preliminary approval in April from the Financial Services Regulatory Authority of ADGM to operate a crypto asset platform and wallets.

Last September, Richard Teng, head of the Financial Services Regulatory Authority of the ADGM, claimed that loss and theft of cryptocurrency negatively impacts its image as an asset.

In February of this year, six commercial banks from Saudi Arabia and the UAE joined a digital currency project after the authorities of both the countries announced an agreement to cooperate on the creation of a cryptocurrency in January.

As Cointelegraph reported last October, the Dubai government also intends to use a digital currency backed by the state and pegged to the UAEâ€™s fiat currency, the dirham, for utilities payments.
