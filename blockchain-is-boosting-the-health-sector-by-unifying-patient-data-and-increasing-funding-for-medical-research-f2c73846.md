By increasing the security and transparency of medical data, they could give patients greater assurance that their personal info is being protected, which in turn could increase trust in medical institutions and make people likelier to put their lives in the hands of health professionals.

As the press release explained, this system would be part-private and part-public, enabling patients to approve the transfer of their medical data from one health institution to another.

According to Lancor CEO Aamir Butt, blockchain technology will be applied mostly to medical data, but this will still enable health professionals and institutions to target treatment more effectively.

Not only does blockchain provide incentives to add more data to health care systems, but it will actually incentivize people to show up to their appointments.

However, Aamir Butt affirms that the cryptographic and distributed aspects of blockchain tech provide a reliable way of minimizing threats to data security:

"The use of cryptographic handshakes before data is transferred ensures that the right information is allocated to the right patient, and the right tests are performed so that the right future care can be planned and delivered.

Not only does this cut down on the cost of research, but Insight will also reward those who share new data with the blockchain-based platform, with rewards coming in the form of funding and medical technology.

## Obstacles

The fact that blockchain has a potentially bright future in the health industry is also indicated by the increasing role itâ€™s having in medical insurance and medical licenses, where the likes of MetLife and the Illinois state government have been testing DLT-based systems that will secure the corresponding data.
