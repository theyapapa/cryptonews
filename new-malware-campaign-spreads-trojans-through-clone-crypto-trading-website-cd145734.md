# New Malware Campaign Spreads Trojans Through Clone Crypto Trading Website ...

###### 2019-06-05 19:06

Twitter user and malware researcher Fumik0\_ has discovered a new website that spreads cryptocurrency malware, according to a report by Bleeping Computer on June 5.

According to the report, the host for transmitting these viruses is a website that imitates the website for Cryptohopper, a website where users can program tools to perform automatic cryptocurrency trading.

The Vidar information-stealing trojan itself will attempt to scrape user data such as browser cookies, browser history, browser payment information, saved login credentials, and cryptocurrency wallets.

The Qulab clipboard hijacker will attempt to substitute its own addresses in the clipboard when it recognizes that a user has copied a string that looks like a wallet address.

One wallet reportedly associated with the clipper has received 33 BTC, or $258,335 at press time, via the substitution address ‘1FFRitFm5rP5oY5aeTeDikpQiWRz278L45,’ although this may not all have come from the Cryptohopper scam.

After users ran the alleged BTC generator, which was automatically downloaded by visiting the associated website, they would be infected with a Qulab trojan.

Then, the Qulab trojan would attempt to steal user information and run a clipboard hijacker for crypto addresses.
