A United States District Attorney has charged the founders of an international cryptocurrency pyramid scheme that involved the marketing of an allegedly fraudulent digital currency called “OneCoin.”

The siblings were accused of “wire fraud, securities fraud, and money laundering offenses,” wherein they allegedly lured investors to contribute “billions of dollars in the fraudulent cryptocurrency.”

The project operates as a marketing network through which members receive commissions for attracting other potential investors to buy cryptocurrency packages.

When Ignatov was asked when OneCoin members could “cash out” their coins at a meeting with investors in Las Vegas, he said “if you are here to cash out, leave this room now, because you don’t understand what this project is about.”

New York County District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance, Jr. stated that “these defendants \[the Ignatovs\] executed an old-school pyramid scheme on a new-school platform, compromising the integrity of New York’s financial system and defrauding investors out of billions.”

Last month, the U.S. Department of Justice charged a New York-based operator, Randall Crater, of a purported cryptocurrency payment services firm My Big Coin Pay Inc. (My Big Coin) with wire fraud and unlawful monetary transactions.

The indictment states that Crater conducted four counts of wire fraud and three counts of unlawful monetary transactions, as well as misappropriated more than $6 million in investor funds for personal use.
