# XRP Community Is Threatening a ‘Takeover’ if Ripple Execs Keep Dumping ...

Anger about the negative market consequences of Ripple selling XRP to its clients is prompting token holders to conceive of ever-more ingenious means to fight back.

## “We will stage a community takeover”

Earlier today, Crypto Bitlord tweeted to Ripple’s CEO and CTO:

“Brad Garlinghouse, Joel Katz, you now have 60 days to stop dumping XRP or we will stage a community takeover.

As previously reported, Ripple’s quarterly reports have consistently revealed the high number of XRP tokens the company is selling to fund its investments in different firms that have the potential to grow the XRP ecosystem and to fund its operations.

The most recent, published late July, revealed a quarter-to-quarter increase of XRP sales of around 48%.

## The security classification hangover

In addition to responding to allegations of purported dumping, Garlinghouse also alluded — but refrained to comment in detail on — recent amendments to an ongoing class action suit against Ripple, in which an investor has alleged that the firm sold XRP as an unregistered security in violation of federal law.

The new filing notably cited guidance issued by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to corroborate its claim that XRP counts as a security.

Garlinghouse briefly responded, stating that “SEC guidance isn't issued by the Commission and isn't law, rule or regulation,” and noting that the United Kingdom and others have come out clearly against a securities classification for the token.
