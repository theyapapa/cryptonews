# Amateur Cryptojackers and Apple Macs Emerge as Two Mining Malware Trends for 2018 ...

###### 2018-09-30 18:09

And it would seem that 2018 has so far been an even bigger year for mining malware, as the Cyber Threat Alliance September report revealed that, beginning on Jan. 1, cryptojacking still had room to increase by a further 500 percent.

Despite reports from some quarters showing that mining malware detections increased in the first two quarters of 2018, other reports suggest that they have in fact decreased.

And while the overall growth in mining malware since last year has been attributed to the volatility of cryptocurrency prices and the existence of software bugs, other factors have played a significant role, such as the involvement of amateur cryptojackers and the cost of mining legitimately.

## Amateur cryptojackers

If there's one dominant trend this year in the underworld of cryptojacking, it's that most mining malware focuses on Monero.

McAfee noted in a report from April that the vast majority of its detections were of CoinMiner, a piece of malware that surreptitiously inserts code taken from the CoinHive XMR mining algorithm into the victim's computer.

"Taken in aggregate, when criminals install cryptocurrency miners in large enterprise networks, the costs in excess energy usage, degraded operations, downtime, repairs of machines with physical damage and mitigation of the malware in systems incurred by the victims far outweigh the relatively small amount of cryptocurrency the attackers typically earn on a single network."

It's not clear whether this decline is the result of an increase in profitability for legit Monero miners, of business and individuals wising up to the threat of cryptojacking, or of a general decline in the value of cryptocurrencies.
