As bitcoin’s price keeps setting new yearly highs, the question on everyone’s mind right now is whether it’s different this time.

As many experts pointed out, BTC going above the key psychological $10,000 mark is likely to trigger FOMO (i.e., fear of missing out), according to Fundstrat’s Tom Lee, who adds that bitcoin can now easily take out its all-time highs.

In other words, retail investor FOMO has not even started yet, which may suggest that BTC price could go much higher than last time.

“CME Bitcoin futures (BTC) shows growing signs of institutional interest,” CME Group tweeted June 18.

“BTC open interest rose by a record 643 contracts in a single day, establishing a new all-time high of 5,311 contracts on June 17 (26,555 equivalent bitcoin; ~$250M notional).”

A popular bitcoin market analyst known as PlanB suggests that investors may not be waiting this time around for the expected reduction in supply.

Historic BTC market cycles, rising institutional interest alongside an increasingly robust network fundamentals, as well as the confirmed depreciating value of fiat currencies, could all propel bitcoin’s price orders of magnitude higher than in 2017.
