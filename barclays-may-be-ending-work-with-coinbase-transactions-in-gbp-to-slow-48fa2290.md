# Barclays May Be Ending Work With Coinbase, Transactions in GBP to Slow ...

British banking giant Barclays has reportedly cut ties with United States crypto exchange Coinbase.

As Coindesk reported on August 13, unnamed industry sources have said that Barclays will no longer be banking for Coinbase, severing a relationship that began when Coinbase opened a Barclays account in March 2018.

The news is expected to hit the crypto community hard, as, in addition to linking a major crypto exchange with a heavy hitter among the traditional banking establishment, the break may end Coindesk users’ access to the United Kingdom’s Faster Payments Scheme (FPS) and slow the exchange of cryptocurrencies for British pounds sterling dramatically.

But it’s about Barclays’ comfort level with crypto as a whole.”

Reportedly, Coinbase will continue its access to UK banking through Clearbank, a younger and less established operation.

This is not the first time that Barclays has taken a step back from increasing involvement in the crypto sphere.

Also in July, Cointelegraph reported that Coinbase’s CEO Brian Armstrong was looking to take the exchange beyond trading, expressing plans to expand Coinbase into wider promotion of crypto adoption.
