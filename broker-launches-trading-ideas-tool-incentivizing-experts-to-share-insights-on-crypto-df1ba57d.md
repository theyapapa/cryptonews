# Broker Launches ‘Trading Ideas’ Tool ​—​ Incentivizing Experts to Share Insights on Crypto ...

###### 2019-03-25 11:03

Known as Trading Ideas, the feature enables traders to share their insights on movements in the stock markets, forex and crypto worlds.

Whenever somebody clicks it and signs up for the platform, the account will be connected to the Unilink account of the user who published the Trading Idea.

Widgets are fully customizable and provide real-time quotes, charts and currency converters of all the trading symbols available on SimpleFX.

## A modern CFD trading broker

SimpleFX argues that many well-established CFD brokers provide “outdated online trading tools” that are not in keeping with what sophisticated users demand and expect in today’s marketplace.

Bolstering the sense of community on its platform, SimpleFX also provides a shoutbox where traders can enjoy engaging discussions and ask questions to other users — giving them access to insights and experiences they may not find anywhere else.

The team notes that SimpleFX WebTrader won the competition for the best trading platform during the Finance World Expo Summit that took place on March 6 and 7 in Zug, Switzerland.

The jury panel rewarded the trading app for “great usability on mobile devices,” “remarkable speed and reliability,” “responding to the user needs with new features” as well as “the strong and growing community of users.”
