# Singapore's Monetary Authority Halts Local STO Due to Regulatory Violations ...

###### 2019-01-24 08:01

The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has prevented a local initial coin offering (ICO) from launching a security token offering (STO) in the country.

Under the current rules, all STOs have to comply with Singaporeâ€™s securities laws and are obliged to register with the MAS.

The issuer of the halted, unnamed STO intended to rely on the exemption that would allow them to launch an offering without registering with the MAS.

Shortly after the MAS warning, the issuer has temporarily suspended the STO.

The MAS has also warned investors about the risks linked with token offerings, such as possible price speculation, the possibility of fraud and the lack of a proven track record from the companies.

As Cointelegraph previously wrote, the MAS is responsible for enforcing crypto regulation in Singapore.

The MAS also took part in a blockchain trial conducted by Singapore Exchange Limited (SGX) in October.
