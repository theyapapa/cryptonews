Coinbase also reported that approximately 70% of the top 50 universities offered crypto and blockchain courses external to their computer science departments in areas like law, the humanities and economics.

Computer Science is still the most common area, containing 32.2% of the blockchain- and crypto-related course offerings.

“Currently, over 40% of the world’s top 50 universities already offer at least one class on blockchain or crypto assets.

To truly close the skills gap, universities around the world must expand these programmes to offer blockchain and crypto-asset training courses that directly relate to roles in industry.”
