The widow of the founder of now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange QuadrigaCX has asked the court for $225,000 in compensation for legal costs, Bloomberg reports on March 4.

Jennifer Robertson, the wife of late QuadrigaCX founder Gerry Cotten, is seeking repayment for financing used to help the crypto exchange acquire court-approved protection from creditors.

After $145 million in crypto assets went missing following Cotten’s death, Robertson provided interim financing for legal proceedings.

According to Bloomberg, Robertson paid CA$300,000 (~$225,000), which covered Big Four audit firm Ernst & Young’s (EY) appointment as a monitor to the legal proceedings, in addition to fees associated with filing under Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA) and appointing new directors.

While the issue of repaying Robertson was reportedly discussed in court, the law firm representing QuadrigaCX’s affected clients, Cox & Palmer, took issue with the repayment.

In a letter filed directly to the court, the firm argued that repayment should not be granted until EY has reviewed asset and transaction information from Cotten’s estate.

Recently, crypto research and consulting platform ZeroNonCense published a report claiming that QuadrigaCX stored a significant quantity of Ethereum (ETH) in other crypto exchanges, such as Kraken, Bitfinex and Poloniex.
