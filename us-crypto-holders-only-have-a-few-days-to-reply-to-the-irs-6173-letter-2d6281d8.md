# US Crypto Holders Only Have a Few Days to Reply to the IRS 6173 Letter ...

The IRS has begun sending letters to taxpayers with digital currency transactions that potentially failed to report income and pay the resulting tax from digital currency transactions or did not report their transactions properly.

If you filed incorrect reports for one year or all years from 2013-2017

If you did not report your full activity, including all transactions from all blockchains and exchanges since 2013, then you have filed an incorrect report.

Due to a lack of knowledge regarding crypto tax practices, many who reported in the early years of crypto did not submit an accurate report.

The report must include all activities — wallets, blockchain and exchange information — for the relevant years.

In what is essentially a turnkey tax solution for crypto, it can run the full gamut of related activities — including wallets, exchanges, initial coin offerings, etc. — and even goes so far as to issue one comprehensive report on the relevant years of activity for each year separately.

While the specific identification method identifies the exact Bitcoin that you sold and calculates your tax liability on the sale of the actual Bitcoin based on the blockchain evidence, the first-in-first-out (FIFO) method does not take real-time user activity into consideration.

In order to calculate using the specific identification method, you need to identify (by using evidence from the blockchain) the purchase dates and sales date of all Bitcoin that came in and out of your wallet for the same tax year.
