Some of the world’s leading automobile companies have been exploring the applications of blockchain technology and how it can be used to improve vehicles, the systems that operate them as well as how they interact with the world around them.So how is blockchain being used to drive the development of autonomous vehicles around the globe?

The success of the project could be a potential driver for the use of blockchain technology to facilitate settlement systems for autonomous vehicles.

While this is the latest instance of blockchain-powered autonomous vehicle interaction, there have been a number of major projects that are leveraging blockchain technology to store and use vehicle data.

When making use of the blockchain technology, other users data remains secure, but autonomous vehicles can access the information in order to improve their navigation on the road.

## Payment solutions for autonomous vehicles

Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies have proven their worth as disruptive payment alternatives, and this very application is one that is being actively developed for use by autonomous vehicles.

Having co-authored a published use-case paper on blockchain technology for autonomous vehicles, the researcher told Cointelegraph that the applications of the technology in the automotive industry are plain to see, from payments per transport or unit of fuel, data-sharing for traffic and better transport to insurance.

Insurance companies may or may not find blockchain technologies as the best fit for their services, but trustless exchange of transport (sort of a carpool in which you can sign a contract with literally anybody to pay per kilometer), fuel, or any other product/service seems to me like a perfect fit for the current industry, and especially the future autonomous vehicles and machine to machine communications.”
