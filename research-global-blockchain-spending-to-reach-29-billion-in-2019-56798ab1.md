Global spending on blockchain solutions will reach $2.9 billion in 2019, according to a recent report from advisory services firm International Data Corporation (IDC) published on March.

The report dubbed “Worldwide Semiannual Blockchain Spending Guide” was prepared by market intelligence and advisory firm IDC.

The report analyzes the emerging blockchain market evaluating spending data for 10 technologies across 19 industries and 15 use cases in nine geographic regions.

For the period from 2018 to 2022, blockchain spending will purportedly see a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 76 percent, with total spending reaching the $12.4 billion mark in 2022.

That is followed by the manufacturing and resources sector led by the retail and professional services industries, which will see blockchain spending of $653 million and $642 million this year, respectively.

Per the report, IT and business services will jointly see about 70 percent of all blockchain spending in 2019, while blockchain platform software will be the biggest sector of spending outside of the services category, with a five-year CAGR of 81.2 percent.

The report adds:
