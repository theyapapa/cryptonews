# Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, EOS, Litecoin, Binance Coin, Stellar, Cardano, TRON: Price Analysis April 24 ...

###### 2019-04-24 14:04

Conversely, if the bears sink the BTC/USD pair below the 20-day EMA, it can slide to the next support at $4,914.11.

If the bulls fail to push the price back above $167.32 within the next couple of days, the ETH/USD pair can drop to the 50-day SMA.

## BCH/USD

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has broken down of the 20-day EMA and is on its way to the next support at $255.

With the 20-day EMA weakening and the RSI in the negative territory, the bears are attempting to regain the upper hand.

Nonetheless, if the EOS/USD pair bounces off the 50-day SMA, the bulls will try to push the price back above the 20-day EMA and the downtrend line.

If the price rebounds from the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again try to retest the lifetime highs.

The 50-day SMA is just below this level, hence, we anticipate a strong support at this level, but if the price fails to hold this support, it will complete a bearish rising wedge pattern that has a minimum target objective of $13.60.
