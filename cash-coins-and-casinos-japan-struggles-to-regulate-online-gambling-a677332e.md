Despite Japan’s reputation for being one of the most welcoming nations for fintech, online crypto gambling has struggled to take off in light of the country’s strict regulation.

In late March, the blockchain-based, decentralized application (DApp) platform Tron announced that it would block gambling DApps in Japan, bringing the issue of regulating crypto gambling back to public attention.

Cointelegraph takes a look at the legal and cultural approaches to gambling in Japan, along with how developers believe attempts to halt crypto gambling can only last so long.

## Gambling, cultural attitudes and the law in Japan

In July 2018, Japanese lawmakers passed a controversial bill legalizing gambling resorts after a legal struggle spanning nearly two decades.

Satoshi Ashibe, operator of the online sports betting service Jukebucks.com, gave his private view about the many faces of gambling in Japan and attempts to regulate it:

Despite the apparent attempts from the government to show a tough stance toward gambling and a desire to develop the industry on its own terms, innovators within the industry still remain cautiously optimistic that both crypto and blockchain gambling are compatible with the new era.

As Ashibe explained, users face issues common to all international transactions in fiat currencies — i.e., remittances, regulation and commissions:
