# BMO Chief Investment Strategist: Too Soon to Call Bitcoin a Safe Haven ...

Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at the investment banking company BMO Capital Markets, said that he thinks it is premature to call Bitcoin (BTC) a safe haven from economic turmoil.

And I think the longer-term perspective, in terms of Bitcoin being that safe haven, I think it’s way too soon to call that.”

In such an environment, investors often seek safe havens for their assets and Bitcoin, as some argue, is one such hedge against volatile economic conditions.

## Ongoing debate over Bitcoin as a safe haven

Experts have been arguing that Bitcoin is a safe haven since at least 2016.

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, managing director at Wedbush Securities Inc Gil Luria wrote to Bloomberg on the topic, remarking on the cryptocurrency as a potential safe haven from the British pound post-Brexit:

"I believe bitcoin has seen some of the benefit from the Brexit over the last few days as consumers are buying bitcoin as an asset uncorrelated with the global monetary system, much like gold.

However, Netcoins Michael Vogel noted — again in 2016 — that opinions were divided:

“In some circles Bitcoin is still considered a high-risk investment vehicle, while others consider Bitcoin to be the ultimate safe haven investment.”

While skeptics like Belski have voiced their uncertainty over Bitcoin as a safe haven, a number of other experts disagree.
