Spencer Dinwiddie of the Brooklyn Nets professional basketball team is reportedly planning to tokenize his $34 million NBA contract extension.

Following a three-year $34 million NBA contract extension, Dinwiddie is reportedly going to sell digital tokens tied to the contract, wherein investors in the offering would receive principal and interest, Fox Business reported on Sept. 14.

## NBA gradually embraces crypto 

Dinwiddie thus joined other NBA players engaged with digital currency.

In August, the Dallas Mavericks became the second NBA team to accept Bitcoin (BTC) as a means of payment for match tickets and merchandise.

Back in 2014, the Mavs’ rivals, the Sacramento Kings, became the first NBA team to accept Bitcoin for promotional products as well as for tickets.

Also that month, the NBA and its affiliated union — the National Basketball Players Association — partnered with Dapper Labs of CryptoKitties-fame to release a new crypto collectibles game.

In mid-August, news broke that legendary American professional boxer Mike Tyson was spearheading a new blockchain-based entertainment platform for fighters dubbed Fight to Fame.
