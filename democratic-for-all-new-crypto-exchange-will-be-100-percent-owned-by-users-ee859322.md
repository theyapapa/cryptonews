DAREX’s hybrid model enables users to trade utilities and securities – and the revenue generated from these transactions is subsequently shared with token holders.

The platform is going to be “100 percent owned” by the Darico community through the distribution of Darico Exchange Community Shares – known as DECS for short.

As well as paving the way for profit distribution, these security tokens would enable holders to have voting rights – giving them a say on how the exchange develops in the future.

DAREX is the third launch for the Darico ecosystem – and DECS is a collaboration between Darico and Polymath, a “specialized tokenization service that helps companies launch securities tokens on blockchain.”

## Secure, fast, reliable, transparent

The team behind DAREX says the hybrid exchange is going to pride itself on a “transparent business model” where a prominent auditing firm produces quarterly reports which are compliant with international standards – a practice that’s commonly followed by conventional financial companies.

From a security perspective, DAREX says “failproof” cold storage is going to be used which protects funds held on the exchange, while ensuring they are accessible at all times.

Offering a vision of how its platform will look in the future, its white paper adds: “With liquidity in the cryptocurrency market gradually increasing we believe that by 2020 it will be time to implement a decentralized exchange structure.
