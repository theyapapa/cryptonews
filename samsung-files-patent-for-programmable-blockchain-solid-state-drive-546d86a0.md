South Korean consumer electronics giant Samsung has filed a patent for a blockchain-enabled Solid State Drive (SSD).

## “Programmable blockchain solid state drive and switch”

Local industry news outlet Decenter reported on Sept. 3 that Samsung applied for the “programmable blockchain solid state drive and switch” patent on Jan. 15 and that it has been published on Feb. 2.

To achieve this objective, Samsung intends to use Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).

This kind of devices can be programmed to be predisposed to calculate algorithms in a way more efficient than general-purpose computer devices can.

## Samsung is taking crypto seriously

Samsung, one of the biggest producers of electronics in the world, has been integrating ever more blockchain based-features into its mobile devices.

Last month, the electronics giant integrated Pundi X’s XWallet app into their Samsung Blockchain Wallet alongside over 30 other cryptos.

As Cointelegraph reported last month, Chinese online retail giant Alibaba has applied for a United States patent entitled “Domain Name Management Scheme for Cross-Chain Interactions in Blockchain Systems.”
