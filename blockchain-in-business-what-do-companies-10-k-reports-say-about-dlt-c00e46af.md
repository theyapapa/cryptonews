# Blockchain in Business: What Do Companies’ 10-K Reports Say About DLT? ...

###### 2019-08-11 09:08

Given its inherent credibility compared to, say, a marketing campaign, social media post or presentation at a technology conference, as well as the focus of these reports on current shareholders and future investors, we examine companies’ propensity to discuss blockchains in their 10-Ks in order to measure the degree of their investment in this technology.

## Traditional companies

Some companies that mentioned blockchains or distributed ledgers expressed positive statements about their blockchain services, investments, patents and products while other corporations identified blockchains/distributed ledgers as a risk that could adversely affect their financial and operational performance.

Eastman Kodak wrote in its 2018 10-K report, “Kodak cannot predict whether, or the extent to which, the trading price of the Company’s common stock will continue to be affected by blockchain or cryptocurrency markets and any volatility in such markets.”

## Blockchain startups

In contrast to the vast majority of corporations not writing about blockchain technology (or saying very little), a few of the 10-K reports surveyed are from blockchain startups, and thus frequently mentioned blockchain.

As required by Form 10-K, these corporations all acknowledged the risks of immature blockchain technologies in their reports.

In formal disclosures such as 10-K reports, 99.3% of corporations either didn’t reveal or simply aren’t pursuing any efforts associated with blockchain/distributed ledgers over the past five years, if they are pursuing any, suggesting that blockchains had little material significance to their businesses, risk factors, and/or financial and operational results.

Among the traditional companies that did mention blockchain/distributed ledgers, most made a few positive or a few negative statements about blockchain technologies.
