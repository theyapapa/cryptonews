###### 2018-12-25 22:12

A Japanese fintech company has unveiled a system that is designed to address the price volatility seen when cryptocurrencies are used for remittances.

This is why the firm has devised the Equivalent Value Overseas Remittance System, which is known as EVOR for short.

The speed at which this transaction takes place is a crucial factor in ensuring that the value of a remittance is preserved, and Atom Solutions says another advantage is how EVOR offers “the lowest cost possible in the world” in terms of fees.

## A suite of financial services

Atom Solutions says that it wants to offer a suite of financial services extending beyond remittances, all with a view of making crypto more practical for everyday use.

Overall, Atom Solutions says that its concept for remittances is something that has never been implemented in the world before.

Remittances have been growing further in 2018, the World Bank said, and given how these sums of money often serve as crucial lifelines for the recipients, Atom Solutions is hoping their concept will help them access more of this money without losing cash to exorbitant fees.

Atom Solutions is based in Tokyo, and the Equivalent Value Overseas Remittance System is scheduled to be launched at the beginning of March 2019.
