# Level Up! 500 Games to Accept Altcoin as Payment for the First Time ...

###### 2018-10-23 07:10

A “made for gaming” cryptocurrency has become the first-ever altcoin to be accepted by a major gaming platform – in what is being described as good news for developers and players alike.

MobileGO (or MGO for short) has been picked up by Xsolla, a company which aims to help content creators launch, monetize, and market titles.

As part of the deal, developers will also be able to elect to have royalties from Xsolla, paid out to them in MGO, “on a sliding scale percentage of their choice.”

Upon adopting the ERC223-compliant token, Aleksandr Agapitov, founder and CEO of Xsolla, said: “Owners of MGO will soon be able to engage in peer-to-peer match play and organize decentralized gaming tournaments in a way never before possible.

“MGO is essentially the Bitcoin of the gaming industry, the most trusted cryptocurrency that Xsolla is making available to more than half a billion gamers today.”

Whereas they can be waiting for weeks or months to receive royalties, Xsolla says developers will be able to get paid in MGO in as little as 60 hours, as payment requests are going to be processed three times a week.

## “Event of unprecedented scale”

Both Xsolla and MGO believe that its collaboration could send shock waves through the crypto world – and say its tie-up gives the cryptocurrency “a strong potential of becoming the most adopted alternative coin in the world.”
