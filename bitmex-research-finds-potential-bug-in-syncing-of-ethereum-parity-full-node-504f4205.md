# BitMEX Research Finds ‘Potential Bug’ in Syncing of Ethereum Parity Full Node ...

The research arm of major cryptocurrency trading platform BitMEX has revealed in a blog post on Wednesday, March 13, that its Ethereum Parity full node contains a “potential bug.”

The alleged bug was discovered while analyzing data from Nodestats.org — BitMEX Research’s new website designed to collect key metrics on Ethereum nodes.

Nodestats shows key data for Ethereum Parity and Ethereum Geth clients — which BitMEX reports are the two largest Ethereum node client implementations — and compares requirements related to CPU usage, memory (RAM), bandwidth and storage space.

The team started collecting data from the the Ethereum Parity full node on March 1, reporting that as of March 12, the node was still not completely synced with the Ethereum blockchain.

According to the researchers, however, the slow sync is currently not an issue for the network:

“While the slow initial sync is a potential problem, at least for this system setup, Ethereum has not yet reached a point where the node cannot catch up, as the sync is faster than the rate of blockchain growth.”

However, BitMEX Research further identified a “potential bug” in the client, reporting that the Parity node “sometimes reports that it is in sync, despite being several hundred thousand blocks behind the chain tip.”

According to BitMEX’s blog post, the main goal of the project is to provide metrics related to the computational resources each Ethereum node requires.
