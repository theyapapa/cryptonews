# Winklevoss Twins Believe Stablecoins, Tokenized Securities Are Future of Crypto Innovation ...

Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, Bitcoin (BTC) bulls and founders of the cryptocurrency trading platform Gemini, have said stablecoins and tokenized securities will usher in a bright future for the digital currency space.

Cameron Winklevoss steered the conversation beyond regulatory matters and onto what he said Gemini considers to be an important new development for digital assets: stablecoins and tokenized securities.

Noting that much of the twins’ focus and work to date has been on virtual commodities such as Bitcoin, he said that a compelling new use for crypto will be virtual security tokens backed by real assets:

“The ICO mania of 2017 — we view that as the Pets.com of the securities token world.

Tyler pitched in to point out that United States dollar-pegged stablecoins — which are designed to experience less price volatility than non-fiat collateralized crypto assets — could notably be used to issue dividends in a prospective tokenized securities sector.

As reported, the twins unveiled their own New York regulator-approved, dollar-backed, ECR-20 compatible stablecoin, the Gemini dollar (GUSD), last September.

The twins made the argument that less volatile crypto assets are better suited for use in retail payments than coins such as Bitcoin — making an ironic reference to the pizza that was famously bought with 50,000 BTC back in 2010 — a takeout that would today have cost around $35.8 million, given Bitcoin’s value at press time.

As reported, stablecoins have been gaining increasing traction with crypto and blockchain industry figures, with Jeremy Allaire, co-founder & CEO of Circle, envisioning them as an integral component of an emerging tokenized global economy at MoneyConf in Dublin last year.
