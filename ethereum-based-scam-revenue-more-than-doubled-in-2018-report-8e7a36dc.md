The value of Ethereum (ETH) stolen via scams reached $36 million 2018, according to a report released by crypto analytics company Chainalysis on Jan. 23.

According to the Chainalysis report, scams that occurred last year were reportedly more sophisticated, bigger and vastly more lucrative.

Chainalysis reports that the value of stolen funds more than doubled in 2018, compared to the $17 million in ETH obtained through scams in 2017.

From late 2016 to the end of 2018, the report found that over 2,000 Ethereum scam addresses received funds from almost 40,000 unique users.

The most common types scams involving ETH, as Chainalysis reports, are initial coin offering (ICO) “exit scams,” Ponzi schemes and phishing attacks, the last of which accounted for over 88 percent of scam profits in 2017.

As Chainalysis reports, the nature of 2018’s scam activity was different when compared to previous years.
