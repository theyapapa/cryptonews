# Report: Canada Revenue Agency Auditing Crypto Investors ...

The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), the governmentâ€™s tax collection service, is reportedly auditing investors in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Forbes reports on March 6.

Per Forbes, the CRA is asking investors to clarify multiple points regarding their crypto investments, such how and through whom they purchased the assets and whether they use cryptocurrency mixing services or tumblers.

While the CRA closely monitors crypto related activities, federal and provincial governments in Canada have created research and development tax incentives.

Laura Gheorghiu, a tax partner at law firm Gowling WLG, previously told Cointelegraph that the CRA classifies cryptocurrencies as a commodity, making the exchange of crypto taxable as a barter transaction and making it taxable as business income or capital gains.

As the April 15 deadline for tax filing looms in the United States, some companies are introducing new services that allow investors to more easily calculate taxes on their crypto holdings.

Yesterday, Big Four auditing firm Ernst & Young launched a tool for accounting and preparing taxes on cryptocurrency holdings.

The new tool called EY Crypto-Asset Accounting and Tax will allow both institutional and retail investors to calculate and prepare taxes on cryptocurrency holdings.
