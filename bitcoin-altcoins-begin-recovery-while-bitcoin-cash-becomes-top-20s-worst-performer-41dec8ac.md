Cryptocurrency markets are recovering from their recent mini crash today, Nov. 16, with only Bitcoin Cash (BCH) going against a trend which saw assets gain as much as 4.3 percent in 24 hours.

The fallout from turbulence over BCH’s controversial hard fork, which occurred Thursday, Nov. 15, appeared not to last, with Bitcoin (BTC) recovering a modest 1.35 percent Friday to trade around $5,590 by press time.

The largest cryptocurrency had fallen hard in the hours leading up to the hard fork, at one point trading as low as $5,146 according to data from Cointelegraph’s price tracker, Coin360, CoinMarketCap, and Bitcointicker.

By contrast, BCH itself has failed to capitalize on the market frenzy, falling almost 8 percent on the day Friday.

For previous altcoin market leader Ethereum (ETH), the outlook still appeared tenuous at press time, a last-minute price surge by Ripple (XRP) causing it to lose its status as the largest altcoin by market cap this week.

Despite a 1.5 percent price improvement to $178 Friday, XRP still gained more, increasing the gap between the market cap of the two assets from $100,000 Thursday to $550,000.

The best performer of the top 20 coins was Stellar (XMR), which gained around 7.2 percent — as much as BCH lost.
