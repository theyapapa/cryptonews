International business media outlet Forbes has partnered with blockchain-based platform Civil to publish its content on a decentralized network, Civil’s co-founder confirmed on Medium on Tuesday, Oct. 9.

According to Civil co-founder Matt Coolidge, Forbes is integrating Civil’s software into its own content management system (CMC).

From the beginning of 2019, journalists will be able to upload their data to the Civil network while posting it to the Forbes website simultaneously.

Forbes, a U.S. business news outlet founded in 1917, reaches more than 120 million people globally through its main and local editions.

Axios writes that through the use of smart contracts, Forbes authors can upload their articles to Forbes’ CMS and then share them on other platforms, such as LinkedIn and Medium.

Civil has previously partnered with major news agency Associated Press (AP).

The AP is also going to store its content in the Civil network as a part of the trial so that news agencies can have immediate access to the reports.
