# Van Eck Associates CEO: Bitcoin Investors Are Moving to Gold ...

###### 2019-01-27 12:01

Jan Van Eck, CEO of Van Eck Associates, suggested that Bitcoin (BTC) investors have moved to gold during an interview with CNBC published on Jan. 26.

Van Eck declared that he thinks “that Bitcoin pulled a bit of demand away from gold last year, in 2017.”

Afterward, he concluded:

“Interestingly, we just polled 4,000 Bitcoin investors and their number one investment for 2019 is actually gold.

So gold lost to Bitcoin and now it's going the other way.”

During the same interview while talking about Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), Tim Seymour, founder and chief investment officer of Seymour Asset Management, declared that Bitcoin’s function as a store of value is questionable:

“Not only have we lost all liquidity on the underlying \[commodity\] but truly outside of the existential blockchain argument, it's been very difficult to argue store of value which is really what we started hearing about.

Van Eck’s firm created what CNBC defined as the most well known gold ETFs, namely the GDX gold miners ETF and the GDXJ junior gold miners ETF.

At the end of last year, Bitcoin’s (BTC) average daily price change was the lowest value reported in the past nine years, Cointelegraph reported.
