# Swiss Regulator Releases AML, KYC Guidance for Blockchain Payments ...

Switzerland’s Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) has released guidance on regulatory requirements for payments on the blockchain under FINMA supervision.

The new guidance for virtual asset service providers, published on Aug. 26, applies to blockchain service providers including exchanges, wallet providers and trading platforms.

## More stringent than the FATF

FINMA underscores that blockchain sector businesses cannot be exempted from the country’s existing regulatory standards, such as the Anti Money Laundering (AML) Act.

Blockchain service providers are thus required to conduct Know Your Customer checks, follow a risk-based approach to monitoring their business relationships and notify the Money Laundering Reporting Office Switzerland should they identify suspicious activity on their platforms.

FINMA notes that it departs from the FATF guidance in refusing to exempt payments involving unregulated wallet providers from its requirements.

Also announced today, social media sources have claimed that FINMA has approved banking licenses for two blockchain service providers, Sygnum and Seba.

This spring, blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis had urged the FATF to rethink its guidance and reporting demands for VASPA, arguing that forcing onerous requirements onto “regulated VASPs, who are critical allies to law enforcement, could reduce their prevalence, drive activity to decentralized and peer-to-peer exchanges, and lead to further de-risking by financial institutions.”
