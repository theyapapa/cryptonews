# Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, EOS, Stellar, Litecoin, Cardano, Monero, TRON: Price Analysis, October 26 ...

###### 2018-10-26 16:10

A breakdown of this support can trigger protective stops on the long positions, quickly dragging prices to the lower levels of $5,450 and $5,000.

We expect the price to either breakout or breakdown of the $6,831.99â€“$5,900 range within the next few days, resulting in a new uptrend or a downtrend.

A sharp, large range up move from current levels can carry the digital currency to $0.50, above which we expect buying interest to increase.

## BCH/USD

The bulls have not been able to bounce off the support line of the symmetrical triangle, which is a bearish sign.

A range expansion from the current levels can carry the EOS/USD pair to the overhead resistance of $6.8299, which will act as a strong resistance.

## XLM/USD

After failing to breakout of the downtrend line of the descending triangle, Stellar (XLM) has pulled back to the 50-day SMA, which might act as a strong support.

## LTC/USD

Litecoin (LTC) has formed a bearish descending triangle pattern that will complete on a breakdown and close (UTC time frame) below $49.466.
