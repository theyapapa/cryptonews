Crypto lending firm Nexo has paid its token holders a total of $2,409,574.87 in dividends.

Nexo reportedly has reached an annualized dividend yield of 12.73%.

Nexo announced the completion of its dividend payments in a press release on Aug. 16.

Moreover, Nexo’s dividend yield is purportedly higher than every dividend-paying stock listed on the S&P 500 market index.

Nexo apparently pays out its total dividend in two parts — 50% comes from the Nexo Base Dividend and the other 50% from the Nexo Loyalty Dividend.

Nexo claims that its model is designed to reward long-term investor confidence and decrease market volatility following dividend payouts.
