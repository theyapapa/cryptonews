The Port Authority of the Bay of Algeciras (APBA) has signed an agreement under which it will collaborate with IBM on its shipping platform Tradelens, Europa News reported on Jan. 21.

Tradelens is a digital platform based on blockchain technology developed by both IBM and international shipping giant Maersk.

Per the note, the platform will generate value for shippers, freight forwarders, logistics operators and shipping companies.

Leading port operators have been increasingly implementing blockchain technology to streamline their operations.

In October 2018, the Port of Rotterdam in the Netherlands partnered with major Dutch bank ABN AMRO and the IT subsidiary of Samsung to test blockchain for shipping.

In June 2018, a subsidiary of Abu Dhabi Ports became the first entity in the country to deploy its own blockchain solution.

The leading port operator in the United Kingdom, Associated British Ports, signed an agreement in September 2018 with digital logistics enabler Marine Transport International to develop blockchain for port logistics.
