Over 5.5 billion USD Coin (USDC) tokens have been transferred on-chain as of Jan. 31 2019, according to a report released by the Centre consortium on Feb. 6.

USDC s a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin released by Coinbase and Circle in October of last year.

According to the report, by the end of January 2019 over 86,000 USDC transactions have been completed on the chain.

According to the document, over 8,000 Ethereum addresses hold USDC tokens and over 1.6 billion units of the stablecoin have been traded on cryptocurrency exchanges.

In December 2018, the Paxos Standard (PAX) stablecoin exceeded $5 billion worth of transaction volumes.

According to a report released in December, the adoption of all stablecoins is growing based on the increasing number of on-chain transactions, and the four major stablecoins have already broken the $5 billion mark in on-chain transactions within the three-month period.
