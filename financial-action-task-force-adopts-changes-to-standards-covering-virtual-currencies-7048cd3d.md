The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has adopted changes to its standards regarding digital currencies and firms involved into cryptocurrency-related activities, according to an announcement published Oct. 19.

Paris-based FATF, also known as Groupe d'action financière (GAFI), is an intergovernmental organization established in 1989 on the initiative of the G7 to set standards and promote effective implementation of legal, regulatory and operational measures to fight money laundering.

The FATF has since developed a series of Recommendations recognized as the international standard for combating money laundering (ML) and the financing of illicit activities.

In 2015, the FATF introduced guidance on a risk-based approach to digital currencies, calling all countries to take coordinated action in preventing the use of virtual currencies for crime and terrorism financing (TF).

Now, the organization has determined that the Recommendations require revision as governments and the private sector have sought clarification on exactly which activities the FATF standards apply to.

The FATF also noted that it will provide clarification in ML and TF risks related to virtual currencies, and at the same time develop a regulatory environment where companies are free to innovate.

The statement further reads:

“As part of a staged approach, the FATF will prepare updated guidance on a risk-based approach to regulating virtual asset service providers, including their supervision and monitoring; and guidance for operational and law enforcement authorities on identifying and investigating illicit activity involving virtual assets.”
