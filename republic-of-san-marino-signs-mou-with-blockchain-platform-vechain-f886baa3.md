The Republic of San Marino has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with blockchain application platform VeChain.

The MoU was signed between San Marino Secretariat of Industry, Craft, Trade, Labor, Cooperation and Telecommunications, Republic of San Marino Innovation Institute S.p.A, management systems certification body DNV GL Business Assurance Group AS, and VeChain Foundation Limited.

## “To become the first zero-emissions country in the world”

The cooperation is part of San Marino’s strategy to create and promote an ecosystem of technological innovation and facilitate digital transformation.

The program would reward citizens with so-called San Marino Innovation Tokens issued by San Marino Innovation, which can subsequently be used to access services offered within the Republic.

Secretary Andrea Zafferani said:

“We will give life to a project that will directly engage citizens and reward their sustainable behavior, while also meeting the country’s demands in regards to CO2 emissions reduction, water saving and waste disposal and management.

Sergio Mottola, President of San Marino Innovation, stressed that the program is, “a clear sign of the attractiveness generated by San Marino in regard to technological innovation: these are real projects that will soon provide tangible results.”

The MoU comes in the wake of a governmental decree on blockchain tech for businesses by the captains regent of the Republic of San Marino, Nicola Selva and Michele Muratori in June.
