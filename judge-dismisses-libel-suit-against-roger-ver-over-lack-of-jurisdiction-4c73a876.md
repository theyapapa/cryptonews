# Judge Dismisses Libel Suit Against Roger Ver Over Lack of Jurisdiction ...

A Justice of the High Court of England and Wales has dismissed a libel lawsuit against Bitcoin Cash (BCH) proponent and Bitcoin.com CEO Roger Ver.

Justice Nicklin wrote:

“The Claimant has not satisfied me that England and Wales is clearly the most appropriate place to bring his action for defamation over the publications complained of.

According to Nicklin, the evidence presented led him to believe that England and Wales were purview to very little of the alleged defamation.

While Nicklin offered jurisdiction as the primary grounds for dismissal, he also went on to discuss his doubts about the extent to which Ver actually libelled Wright.

In a back-and-forth battle between the New York Attorney General (NYAG) and Tether, the NYAG claims that some of Tether’s financial activities violated New York law and could have harmed investors in the state.

Conversely, the lawyers defending stablecoin operator Tether — as well as associated crypto exchange Bitfinex and its parent company iFinex — have been arguing that Bitfinex and Tether have not been transacting with any New York customers.

The NYAG has tried to demonstrate that the firms have been operating in New York, therefore giving the office precedent to pursue the case under the Martin Act — a New York-specific finance law — to which the NYAG initially appealed.
