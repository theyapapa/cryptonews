###### 2019-03-10 04:03

Fidelity Digital Assets, the digital currency wing of United States financial services giant Fidelity, is now live with a select group of clients, the firm announced on March 8.

Fidelity had previously announced at the end of January that the platform was in its final testing stages of its new digital asset service.

Also in January, anonymous sources had noted that Fidelity’s Bitcoin (BTC) custody offering would go live by March 2019.

Speaking to CNBC this week, Fidelity Digital Assets head Tom Jessop said that the company is now live, but that they are still working on various parts of the platform.

In the February announcement, Fidelity had stated that they will continue to expand their client base as the firm develops further.

Fidelity CEO Abigail Johnson has been a vocal supporter of digital currencies, having introduced Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) mining at the company in 2017.

I’m one of the few standing before you today from a large financial services company that has not given up on digital currencies.”
