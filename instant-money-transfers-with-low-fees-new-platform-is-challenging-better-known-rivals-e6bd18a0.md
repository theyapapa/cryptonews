# ‘Instant Money Transfers With Low Fees’: New Platform is Challenging Better-Known Rivals ...

###### 2018-11-14 14:11

A digital money platform is challenging rivals by offering instant transfers from a greater number of cryptocurrencies, fiat currencies, and commodities – all with the ambition of reducing the seemingly endless costs and fees customers face.

According to Uphold, it is free to open an account on its platform and transfer funds from bank accounts – and there are also low costs and no limits attached to sending or receiving money (if it is the same currency) to other Uphold members, whether they are down the street or on the other side of the world.

Small fees are applied when an account is funded using a debit card or a credit card, if a member converts funds to a different currency, or if they want to move funds off its platform altogether.

## An array of features

Uphold’s range of fiat currencies is extensive, delivering international appeal.

When compared with other platforms, the company says it helps users to trade across more than 1,000 trading pairs more seamlessly – giving them the freedom to remain in control of their money.

## Transparency and security

Uphold has placed an emphasis on enabling users to see how the service is handling their money.

Just like it has been trying to reduce fees for those sending remittances across borders, the platform is offering ways for companies to transfer funds to international suppliers and members of staff without delays and prohibitive fees.
