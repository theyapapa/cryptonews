TrustToken will release four new stablecoins this year that are pegged to Australian dollars, euros, Canadian dollars, and Hong Kong dollars.

Per the post, TrustToken has expanded into four new digital currencies backed by Australian dollars (TrueAUD), Euros (TrueEUR), Canadian dollars (TrueCAD), and Hong Kong dollars (TrueHKD).

The four stablecoins thus join the recently released British pound-backed stablecoin TrueGBP and its dollar stablecoin TrueUSD (TUSD).

TrueAUD is reportedly subject to similar legal and technical standards as TrueUSD, with collateralizing funds held in a third-party escrow account.

Per the Independent Accountants’ Report prepared by certified public accounting firm Cohen & Company, as of March 31, 2019, the U.S. dollar balance held in escrow accounts was $199,063,885, while the balance of TUSD tokens issued and being in circulation was 198,982,291 TUSD.

In March, TrueUSD revealed a new partnership with accounting firm Armanino, wherein a dashboard developed by Armanino purportedly enables traders to monitor TrueUSD token balances and collateralized funds.

“Armanino connects directly to third-party escrow accounts holding the U.S. dollars that collateralize TrueUSD tokens, and runs their own Ethereum nodes to ensure accurate TUSD token supply,” the announcement detailed.
