# All Quiet on the Crypto Front as Bitcoin, Altcoins Shun Volatility ...

###### 2018-10-26 13:10

An eerie calm continues to linger over cryptocurrency markets Friday, Oct. 26, as Bitcoin (BTC) volatility hits an all-time low and altcoins remain stagnant.

At the same time, one fund management head told the publication, the ongoing bear market should be “getting tired” and a bullish upturn was likely to form Bitcoin’s next move.

At press time, BTC/USD is up just a fraction of a percent over the past 24 hours to trade around $6,480.

Among the altcoins, Ethereum (ETH) is also recording only a minute percent change over the past 24 hours to press time.

ETH/USD is currently trading just under $203, just slightly down since the same time last week against a backdrop of around 8 percent monthly losses.

Across the top twenty altcoin assets, no anomalies to the sideways trading trend had appeared, with coins staying within a tiny 1 percent of their position 24 hours previously.

The only exception is Zcash (ZEC), ranked 19th by market cap, which is seeing a little over 4 percent losses to trade at $121.22 by press time.
