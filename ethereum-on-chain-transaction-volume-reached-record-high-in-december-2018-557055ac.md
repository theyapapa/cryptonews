Conversely, the United States dollar value of the on-chain transactions is at a 22-month low.

Diar further states:

“A 97 percent drop in on chain transaction value from peak in January versus December 2018 was by and large the cause of an 80 percent drop in Ethereum's price.”

Diar states that fees are unlikely to interfere with growth as Ethereum has some of the lowest fees for on-chain transactions.

According to ChainSecurity, the smart contract audit firm that discovered the attack, the Constantinople upgrade introduces cheaper gas cost (transaction fees) for some operations on the Ethereum network.

Following a fix by developers, Diar states that the Constantinople upgrade will decrease fees for certain types of transactions, which will allow for better storage use.
