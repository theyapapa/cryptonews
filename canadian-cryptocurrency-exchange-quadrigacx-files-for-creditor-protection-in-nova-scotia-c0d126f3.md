Following months of financial and legal troubles, major Canadian cryptocurrency exchange QuadrigaCX has filed for creditor protection, according to an official announcement on Jan. 31.

Per a statement on the exchange’s website, the firm filed an application for creditor protection in the Nova Scotia Supreme Court today in compliance with the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA).

In October 2018, the exchange disputed a $19.6 million sum with the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC).

Per Canadian news daily the Globe and Mail, QuadrigaCX had been experiencing difficulties accessing $16.3 million of its funds since January, when the CIBC froze five accounts belonging to Jose Reyes, the exchange’s owner, and its payment processor, Costodian Inc.

CIBC subsequently requested that the Ontario Superior Court withhold the funds and determine whether they belong to Costodian, the exchange, or the users who deposited the funds.

CIBC was then obliged to pass the funds over to the Accountant of the Superior Court in order to identify the owner.

Following an announcement of Cotten’s passing, some users asked for proof of death, while one even posited the theory that the exchange could not access the assets in cold storage, as the keys were only known to Cotten.
