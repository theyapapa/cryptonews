# Staking Claim on Bitcoin — Does Craig Wright’s Copyright Filing Hold Legal Merit? ...

And while explanations for sudden market shifts are often hard to come by in the cryptocurrency industry, some within the media pinned BSV's abrupt climb on the news that nChain founder Craig Wright had filed a copyright registration for the original bitcoin white paper with the United States Copyright Office.

One is a claim for the original bitcoin white paper, while the other is for most of the bitcoin 0.1 source code, with the nChain press release concerning these registrations summarizing them in the following way:

"U.S. copyright registration no.

Nonetheless, they don't provide any real evidence of bitcoin authorship, since — as numerous commentators have pointed out — it's highly unlikely that the Copyright Office required proof that Wright is "Satoshi Nakamoto" prior to registering the claim.

In fact, such dismissals prompted the U.S. Copyright Office to respond on May 22 to the clamor over Wright's new claim by releasing a press statement.

The nChain press release did state that the Copyright Office registered the claim "after receiving confirmation from Wright that he is Satoshi Nakamoto."

So, if the registered copyright claims don't or can't prove anything about Craig Wright's involvement with bitcoin, the question arises as to why the Australian would want to file them.

The difficulties in suing on the basis of copyright claims don't end there for Wright, who stated in his press release that he has been "dismayed to see his original bitcoin design bastardized by protocol developer groups — first by Bitcoin Core (BTC) in 2017 and then again by bitcoin cash (BCH) developers in 2018."
