Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis has launched transaction alerts for suspicious exchanges of a range of cryptocurrencies.

In a post published on the firm’s blog on Aug. 22, Chainalysis announced the launch of alerts for suspicious cryptocurrency transactions in Chainalysis Know Your Transaction (KYT), the company’s real-time anti-money laundering compliance solution.

## Compliance risk mitigation

The tool is meant to help cryptocurrency exchanges and other financial institutions mitigate their regulatory and reputational risks.

Michael Breu, chief compliance officer at major crypto exchange Gemini, is quoted in the announcement:

“As a New York Trust company we are required to monitor transactions on and off our platform.

According to the article, the company’s KYT service has always included real-time transaction monitoring for large volumes of cryptocurrency activity to identify high-risk behavior.

\[...\] Every minute counts when managing exposure to sanctioned entities, hacked funds, darknet markets, and other illicit activities, which is why Chainalysis is investing in fast, actionable alerts to help our customers mitigate risk across cryptocurrencies."

As Cointelegraph reported at the beginning of July, Chainalysis claims that 64% of ransomware attack cash-out strategies involve the laundering of funds via cryptocurrency exchanges.
