On Thursday, Jan. 31, the General Assembly of the Association elected former Swisscom manager Daniel Haudenschild as president of the CVA and the successor to Oliver Bussmann.

The former CVA’s president, Oliver Bussmann, had announced last November — together with the members Vasily Suvorov, René Hüsler and Nicolas Schobinger — not to run for reelection at the General Assembly.

Haudenschild, the new president of the CVA, was — until the end of January — the CEO of the blockchain advisory unit of Swiss state-owned telecommunications company Swisscom and left the company unexpectedly.

Cointelegraph spoke with Daniel Haudenschild about his new position, conflicts between the management staff and the developer community in the Crypto Valley and the position of Switzerland, especially Zug, as a global blockchain hub.

CT: The four founding members of the CVA — Oliver Bussmann, René Hüsler, Nicolas Schobinger and Vasily Suvorov — have announced their withdrawal from the organization quite surprisingly.

DH: The CVA is a vital component for Switzerland, and one of the strongest ecosystems in blockchain globally.

DH: The perception was that the inquiries into the CVA were being handed off to a select few individuals, and that most members did not have access to the business-generating benefits of membership.
