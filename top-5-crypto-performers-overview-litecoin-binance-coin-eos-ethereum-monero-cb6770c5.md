# Top 5 Crypto Performers Overview: Litecoin, Binance Coin, EOS, Dash, Monero ...

###### 2019-02-10 11:02

Over the past few days, we saw individual cryptocurrencies charting their own course, deifying the absolute leadership of Bitcoin (BTC).

Tron (TRX) and Binance Coin (BNB) are two of the major cryptocurrencies that leaped ahead while Bitcoin continued to languish in a tight range.

Bitcoin has been trading in a tight range for the past few weeks, with many speculating that it will eventually break down, as it did in mid-November of last year.

Meanwhile, Bitcoinâ€™s hash rate rose to its highest level in three months, which could have prompted a few bears to book profits, resulting in a sharp spike.

## BNB/USD

After the successful sale of the BitTorrent (BTT) token that closed within a few minutes, Binance has announced the sale of the Fetch.AI (FET) token on Feb. 25.

Our bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink the cryptocurrency below the channel and the support level at $5.50.

## EOS/USD

The investors are favoring select cryptocurrencies and EOS is one of them.
