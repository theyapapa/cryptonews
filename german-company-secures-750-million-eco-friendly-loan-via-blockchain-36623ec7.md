German-based Dürr, one of the world's leading mechanical and plant engineering firms, has secured a sustainability loan of 750 million euros, the interest on which is linked to its eco-friendly performance.

The credit agreement, reported on Aug. 8 by Finance Magazine (German), was self-initiated by Dürr, utilizing a blockchain-based syndicated loan platform.

Dürr’s latest agreement comes just two weeks after it issued a 200 million euro sustainability “schuldschein,” a popular German financing tool.

Both agreements depend on the company’s sustainability rating, as scored by the Ecovadis agency.
