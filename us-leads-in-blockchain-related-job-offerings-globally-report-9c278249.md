To prepare the report, TNW gathered information from job and recruiting site Glassdoor, finding all the job offerings that had the term “blockchain” in the job listing in countries around the world.

The results reportedly showed that the U.S. is leading the world in terms of blockchain-related jobs, having about half, or 2,616, of a total of 5,711 blockchain jobs listed on Glassdoor globally.

Among the most common jobs posted on the site, “Blockchain Engineer” takes the lead.

Such positions as “Senior Software Engineer” and “Blockchain Developer” are the second and third most popular job titles, respectively.

TNW also made a list of companies offering blockchain-related vacancies, wherein tech giant IBM reportedly offers the greatest number of blockchain jobs, and is followed by Big Four accounting firm Ernst & Young and software company Oracle.

In February, recruitment company Hired released a report showing that the global demand for blockchain engineers is up by 517 percent year-over-year.

The blockchain engineer role also consistently stayed among the top-three most-paid software engineering jobs in the various cities covered in the report.
