## BTC/USD

Bitcoin has plunged to a new year-to-date low, but the decline is still not showing any signs of slowing down.

If the bears maintain their selling pressure, the ETH/USD pair can drop to the next support at $66.

## XLM/USD

After a successful defense of $0.184, the bears have renewed their selling, pushing Stellar to new year-to-date lows.

If the bears succeed in holding the BCH/USD pair below $100, the next support on the downside is $91.78.

## BSV/USD

While the other cryptocurrencies are sliding to new lows, Bitcoin SV is bucking the trend.

If the bulls succeed, the LTC/USD pair might consolidate for a few days, before starting a new uptrend.

## ADA/USD

The downtrend in Cardano has resumed, as the pair makes new year-to-date lows.
