CoinLab has reportedly filed a 1.7 trillion JPY ($16 billion) claim against the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox, according to an alleged photo of the filing document posted on Reddit on Feb. 1.

As Cointelegraph reported in its Mt. Gox recap in March last year, in 2013, CoinLab, a former business partner of the exchange, sued the company for $75 million, claiming breach of contract.

The contract stipulated that CoinLab would take over the American customers of Mt. Gox, but it never happened.

Some in the cryptocurrency community have seen the alleged increase in CoinLab’s claim as unjustified.

A Twitter user tagged Peter Vessenes in a tweet, CoinLab’s co-founder, asking him “Did you submit a $16bn claim in the Mt Gox Civil Rehabilitation?”

In the month before this happened, Nobuaki Kobayashi, trustee of the now-defunct Bitcoin (BTC) exchange Mt. Gox, announced that he is making efforts to extend the deadline for filing civil rehabilitation claims.
