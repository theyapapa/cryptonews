# Over 400,000 ETH Left ICO Team Wallets in the Past Thirty Days, Data Shows ...

Initial coin offerings (ICO) have been transacting Ethereum (ETH) at breakneck speed, with over 400,000 ETH moving out of wallets in the past 30 days alone, according to data from crypto assets data and software development firm Santiment published Dec. 17.

Santiment’s data sample notably does not track the ETH “all the way to exchanges,” with the metric therefore not a hard and fast confirmation that the ETH has necessarily subsequently been sold: Santiment thus qualifies the data as a “suggestion” of “possible selling activity.”

Santiment’s three-month chart for ETH leaving ICO team wallets reveals a significant uptick in outgoings over the preceding 30 days, as compared with data from mid-September to mid-October, and from mid-October to mid-December:

Santiment gives a breakdown of the specific wallets in its sample, ranking the ICO teams according to the amount of ETH “spent” over the thirty-day period.

Other major ICO ETH “sellers” this past month are Aragon (50,000 ETH), Kyber Network (47,290 ETH), Friendz (40,870 ETH) and Status (40,000 ETH).

The two ICO projects with the highest ETH holdings in Santiment’s sample — DigixDAO and Golem — have 395,430 ETH and 369,020 ETH respectively: neither have sold any ETH over the past thirty days.
