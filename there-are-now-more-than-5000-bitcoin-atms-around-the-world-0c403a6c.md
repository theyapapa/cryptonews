The total number of bitcoin ATMs (BTMs) worldwide reached 5,000 for the first time, monitoring resource CoinATMRadar confirmed on June 24.

According to the latest statistics, there are now 5,006 standalone BTMs in around 90 countries, where cryptocurrency users can buy or sell bitcoin (BTC).

The data caps a protracted period of growth in the BTM sector, with the U.S. leading the trend as more and more locations and formats appear.

General Bytes recently overtook Genesis Coin as the manufacturer with the largest number of BTMs installed.

As Cointelegraph reported, in 2019, it is not just the ‘classic’ BTM model which is expanding, but other methods of procuring BTC.

The U.S. currently has more than half of the world’s BTMs at 3,229, with a new pilot scheme this month bringing the machines to Circle K convenience stores in Arizona and Nevada.

Increasing competition in the BTM market is likely to reduce the fees charged to users, which tend to be noticeably higher than online alternatives.
