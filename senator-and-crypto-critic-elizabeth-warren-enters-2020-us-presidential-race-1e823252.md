United States Senator and cryptocurrency critic Elizabeth Warren has announced her bid for President in 2020, the New York Times reported on Dec. 31.

The senator is known for her criticism of cryptocurrencies, having repeatedly expressed concerns that cryptocurrency consumers could be hurt by scam initial coin offerings (ICOs) while also stating that crypto is “easy to steal.”

The Senator also outlined that American consumers are falling victim to cryptocurrency scammers.

Sen. Warren reiterated her critical stance in November, stating:

“It’s American families that end up paying the price when any regulator says we’re more interested in Wall Street.

On Dec. 6, U.S. Representatives Darren Soto and Ted Budd introduced two bills aimed at preventing cryptocurrency price manipulation and optimizing the regulatory framework.

In November, the state of Ohio began accepting cryptocurrency as a payment option to pay taxes.

Other U.S. states have tried to pass bills that would allow taxes to be paid using cryptocurrency.
