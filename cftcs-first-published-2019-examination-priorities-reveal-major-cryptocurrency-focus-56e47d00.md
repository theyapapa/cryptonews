United States regulator the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has announced cryptocurrency will form a priority for its internal examinations this year, according to a press release published on Feb. 12.

The CFTC, which has released its examination priorities for the first time in 2019, will include various crypto-related aspects in its Division of Market Oversight (DMO), Division of Swap Dealer & Intermediary Oversight (DSIO) and Division of Clearing & Risk (DCR) papers.

According to the press release, those priorities pertaining to cryptocurrency include cryptocurrency surveillance practices, as well as other market and trading surveillance including real-time monitoring.

“I commend DMO, DSIO and DCR leadership and staff for their work to bring additional transparency into the CFTC agenda in order to ensure that registered market participants devote adequate compliance resources consistent with our regulatory priorities,” CFTC chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo commented.

The move comes as cryptocurrency regulation continues in earnest both at the CFTC and counterpart the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Others believe the piecemeal issuance of regulations has further repercussions.

Cryptocurrency has already made it onto the radar of certification bodies.
