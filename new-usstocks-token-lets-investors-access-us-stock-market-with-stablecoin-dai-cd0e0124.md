Decentralized financial contracts platform UMA has partnered with Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) MakerDAO to release a token tied to the United States stock market, UMA announced in a blog post on March 27.

The ERC-20 token, dubbed USStocks, seeks to offer investors access to the U.S. stock market using cryptocurrency.

Users can purchase the token using MakerDAO’s own USD-backed stablecoin, Dai (DAI).

“USStocks is an ERC20 token representing synthetic ownership of an index of the 500 largest exchange-listed US stocks.

This means that anybody with access to the internet and digital money can participate in the US stock market,” the blog post explained.

The firm specifies that the token tracks an index of the top 500 firms on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq.

Investors will not take ownership of any stocks, while USStocks ownership represents a bet on a basket, backed by Dai at an overcollateralized ratio of 108.5 percent.
