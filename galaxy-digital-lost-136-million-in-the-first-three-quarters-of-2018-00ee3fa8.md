Mike Novogratz's crypto investment bank Galaxy Digital has lost $136 million in the first three quarters of 2018, Bloomberg reports Nov. 28.

According to Bloomberg, Galaxy Digital’s realized and unrealized losses in Q3 amounted to $41 million, which when combined with the results of previous quarters, amounts to the firm being out $136 million so far this year.

Founded earlier this year, the company explained that the losses were mainly due to tumbling prices of major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ripple (XRP), and Ethereum (ETH).

Galaxy Digital called the lack of crypto trading volumes a “headwind” to success, while stating that the firm “continue\[s\] to improve and strengthen \[their\] trading business.”

Recently, the Novogratz said that he expects cryptocurrency to “flip next year,” also admitting that the year of 2018 “has been challenging” for Galaxy Digital.

In an interview with Financial Times, Novogratz predicted that financial institutions will shift from “investing in cryptocurrency funds to investing in cryptocurrencies proper in the first quarter of next year.”

The Bitcoin price plunged below the $5,600 threshold for the first time in 2018 on Nov. 14.
