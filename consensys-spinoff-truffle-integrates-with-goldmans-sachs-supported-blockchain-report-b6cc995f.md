Truffle is integrating with AxCore, a proprietary blockchain jointly created by Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan-supported Axoni, Forbes reported on April 29.

According to the Forbes report, Truffle plans to use the investment to complete a suite of blockchain development tools designed to appeal to enterprise clients.

An estimated 60% of Truffle’s current revenue comes from liaising with startups, larger corporations and governments that want to use its services.

Truffle’s founder and CEO, Tim Coulter, told Forbes:

“Enterprise adoption is finally happening because the maturity of our space is finally advancing to a level where enterprises can capitalize.”

Coulter added that the U.S.-based company plans to grow beyond the Ethereum ecosystem and “go where the large, important projects are.”

As reported by Cointelegraph last year, Axoni raised $32 million in a funding round led by Goldman Sachs amid plans to process transactions for the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation’s Trade Information Warehouse by using distributed ledger technology.

Cointelegraph has contacted Truffle for comment but has yet to receive a response as of press time.
