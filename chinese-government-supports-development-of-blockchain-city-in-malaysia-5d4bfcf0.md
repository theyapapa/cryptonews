The Chinese government is purportedly supporting the construction of a "blockchain city" in the critical shipping lane of the Malaysian Malacca Strait.

Construction and engineering company China Wuyi and investment network SWT International Sdn Bhd have jointly launched the Chinese government-backed project aimed at the development of the city of Malacca into a blockchain city called Melaka Straits city.

Per the release, the entire infrastructure of the city will be based on blockchain technology, with a so called DMI platform offering its native DMI coin.

DMI will be used to pay government-based services within the city and feature an exchange that will enable Melaka Straits City tourists to exchange their fiat currencies for DMI coins.

The project CEO Lim Keng Kai said that "our company is using cutting-edge blockchain technologies and integrating those into the traditional industry to make Malaysia a world-class tourist destination.

Last June, South Korea revealed plans to launch a blockchain center in Busan city modeled on the Zug-based Crypto Valley, an independent association established for cryptocurrency and blockchain development with the support of government of Switzerland.

The private, anarcho-capitalist city was founded in 2015 as part of the Libertania project, which eschews taxes and government regulation.
