Ripple (XRP), still holding its place as the second top cryptocurrency by market cap after replacing Ethereum (ETH), is also slightly down around 1 percent on the day to press time.

Total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies is around $136.3 billion at press time, down from its high this week of $187 billion.

Recently, Stephen Innes, head of trading at Singapore-based capital market service OANDA Asia Pacific, predicted that gold prices will “jump considerably higher and there’s an inverse relationship we’re starting to see with gold and coins,” while Bitcoin could fall to as low as $2,500 by January 2019.

Crypto analyst Joseph Young subsequently reacted to Innes’ claim on Twitter, pointing out that gold has seen a decline of 33 percent since 2011, “from $1,800 to $1,200,” while “Bitcoin is up 13,900%, from $30 to $4,200” in the same time frame.
