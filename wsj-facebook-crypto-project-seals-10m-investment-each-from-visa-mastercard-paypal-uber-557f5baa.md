Facebook has allegedly sealed backing from over a dozen firms that include Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and Uber for its soon-to-be-unveiled cryptocurrency project.

Source ostensibly familiar with the matter told the WSJ that the firms — extending across the finance, e-commerce, venture capital and telecoms industries — have each invested around $10 million in a consortium that will govern Facebook’s forthcoming digital token, dubbed Libra.

The WSJ’s sources reiterated details that had previously surfaced in regard to the highly secretive project, notably that the social media giant’s forthcoming crypto will allegedly be a fiat-pegged stablecoin, pegged to a basket of national fiat currencies to avoid price volatility.

WSJ reports that purportedly neither Facebook, nor individual consortium members, will control the cryptocurrency, although some members could operate nodes on the network that underlies the crypto payments network — again according to sources allegedly familiar with the setup.

As Cointelegraph has reported, rumors of Facebook’s plans to integrate a cryptocurrency for WhatsApp users first surfaced in December 2018, with further alleged details of the clandestine project emerging in February.

Notably, Facebook purportedly plans to rehaul its messaging infrastructure and integrate its three wholly-owned apps — WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram — under one canopy, bringing its cryptocurrency potential exposure to a combined 2.7 billion users each month.

In May, Facebook reportedly acquired the “Libra” trademark, and there are thought to be around 100 people working on the project, with over 40 listings for the workforce still open.
