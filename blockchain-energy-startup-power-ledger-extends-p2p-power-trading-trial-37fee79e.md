Energy-focused blockchain startup Power Ledger has extended its peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading trial into its next phase in the Australian city of Fremantle.

In a press release shared with Cointelegraph on Aug. 21, Power Ledger revealed the continuation of its p2p solar power trading trial aimed at tracking rooftop solar energy traded between households in Fremantle.

## ‘50,000 transactions per month’

The testing — which is a collaborative effort between Power Ledger, Curtin University, energy generating company Synergy, electricity network operator Western Power and energy services platform energyOS — was originally due for completion in June 2019.

Power Ledger initially started the trial last November, ostensibly processing nearly 50,000 transactions on its blockchain-enabled platform per month since then.

The release explains:

“Western Power’s smart meter data was fed into Power Ledger’s blockchain trading platform and then exported to Synergy’s billing system, to ensure a secure and accurate recording of the energy trading.”

## Management of power use by consumers

According to Power Ledger executive chairman Jemma Green, p2p trading is able to provide customers connected to the electricity grid with a choice to manage their power use.

This month, Power Ledger and Japanese Kansai Electric Power Co. (KEPCO) completed a joint trial of a blockchain-based system for post-FIT (feed-in tariff) surplus power in Osaka.
