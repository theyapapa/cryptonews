# US Rep. Kevin McCarthy Praises Bitcoin while Criticizing Libra ...

United States house minority leader Kevin McCarthy praised Bitcoin (BTC) while criticizing Facebook’s Libra stablecoin during an interview with CNBC published on July 16.

During the interview, McCarthy said:

“I like Bitcoin.

No, but the real thing I like when it comes to Bitcoin is blockchain, ‘cause I like the security.

McCarthy believes that companies entering the space are looking to create a centralized system while tricking consumers into believing that it is decentralized to prevent others from participating in the market.

His opinion is seemingly in stark contrast with the declarations of senator Pat Toomey, who said that he believes that Libra will be launched and the issues surrounding it resolved in another interview with CNBC published the same day.

As Cointelegraph reported in March, McCarthy previously said that blockchain can make the US Congress a more efficient and transparent place.

Also, yesterday news broke that former Republican congressman and presidential candidate Ron Paul says he is in favor of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology because he likes competing currencies.
