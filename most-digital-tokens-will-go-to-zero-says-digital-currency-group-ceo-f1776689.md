Barry Silbert, CEO and founder of Digital Currency Group and Grayscale Investments, said that the majority of digital tokens will not have value in the long run, CNBC reports on Feb. 13.

In a purported phone interview with CNBC, Silbert said “I’m not a believer in the vast majority of digital tokens and I believe most will go to zero."

Despite his bearish views on ICO tokens, Silbert still remains optimistic about Bitcoin (BTC), in which he was reportedly an early investor.

While Bitcoin has "a really ugly technical chart" in Silbert’s opinion, it has “won the race to be digital gold."

Mike Novogratz, a former Goldman Sachs partner and founder of crypto merchant bank Galaxy Digital, said today that Bitcoin is unique among cryptocurrencies.

In regard to Bitcoin’s use as a potential store of value, Novogratz said:

“There’s 118 elements on the periodic table, and only one gold \[...\] Bitcoin is going to be digital gold, a place where you have sovereign money, it’s not U.S. money, it’s not Chinese money, it’s sovereign.

Silbert’s Digital Currency Group is one of several countries that formed the Blockchain Association, the purported first lobbying group representing the blockchain industry in Washington D.C.
