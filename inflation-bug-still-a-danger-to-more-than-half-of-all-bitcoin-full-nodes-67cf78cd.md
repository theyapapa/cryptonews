# Inflation Bug Still a Danger to More Than Half of All Bitcoin Full Nodes ...

Figures published by bitcoin core developer Luke Dashjr show that more than half of the full nodes in the bitcoin network are still running client software vulnerable to the inflation bug discovered in September 2018.

## Most bitcoin full nodes still vulnerable to the inflation bug

As reported by Cointelegraph on May 8, research by Dashjr shows that more than 50% of full nodes on the bitcoin network are still running software versions of the bitcoin client that are susceptible to the inflation bug.

Back in September 2018, developers first discovered the inflation bug â€” which, in theory, could allow miners to inflate the total bitcoin supply beyond the 21 million BTC by spending multiple unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) in the same transaction.

However, several months after the issue ought to have been solved, it appears that more than half the full nodes on the network are still running client implementations vulnerable to the bug.

## All nodes have to do is upgrade

Whenever developers discover a bug of this nature, the solution is always to get nodes to upgrade to a newer version of software that hopefully has features that eliminate the problem.

While this process is ongoing, does the bitcoin network face any credible risk stemming from the fact that half of the full nodes are vulnerable to the inflation bug?

In 2018, bitcoin developer, Jimmy Song expressed the view that rogue miners trying to take advantage of the inflation bug would find it nearly impossible to succeed.
