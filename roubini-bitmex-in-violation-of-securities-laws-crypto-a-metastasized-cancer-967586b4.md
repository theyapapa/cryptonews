Economist and anti-cryptocurrency pundit Nouriel Roubini has recently declared that there is “overwhelming evidence of rampant fraud and abuse” in the crypto space.

Roubini, a professor at NYU’s Stern School of Business, also took aim specifically at the compliance policies of crypto exchange BitMEX in an essay entitled “The Great Crypto Heist.”

According to Roubini, anonymous sources from within BitMex told him that criminals perform a massive amount of money laundering on the exchange:

“BitMEX insiders revealed to me that this exchange is also used daily for money laundering on a massive scale by terrorists and other criminals from Russia, Iran, and elsewhere; the exchange does nothing to stop this, as it profits from these transactions.”

Roubini also criticized the exchange’s anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) regulations at large, going so far as to say that the exchange is in violation of securities laws.

Roubini writes:

“At any rate, we do know that BitMEX skirts AML/KYC regulations.

Roubini recently debated BitMEX CEO and co-founder Arthur Hayes, as he recalls.

Roubini mentioned several studies to support his claim that there exists “overwhelming evidence of rampant fraud and abuse.”
