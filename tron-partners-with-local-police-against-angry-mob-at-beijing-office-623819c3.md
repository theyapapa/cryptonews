The Tron office in Beijing has been surrounded by police as a crowd gathered to protest against a Chinese ponzi scheme that went under a Tron-like name, Twitter personality Crypto Authority reports on July 8.

Videos with crowds surrounded by police officers in the Tron’s office have spread over Twitter, with people apparently coming to express outrage at a local crypto scam that reportedly led to $30 million worth of losses and one suicide.

While Tron has not provided an official feedback on the matter to date, the firm’s CEO Justin Sun has recently warned investors against scam schemes using names of Tron and Tron-owned BitTorrent.

Tron CEO’s response has followed reports on the alleged crypto scam scheme known as “Wave Field Super Community,” which was associated with Tron by local investors, since in China, Tron is reportedly known by the name “Wave Field.”

While Investors claim to have asked Tron to clarify on the connection between the entities, Sun has reportedly not commented on the issue since January, the report notes.

Based on that, angry people went to Tron’s office to express resentment about the company’s silence over the scam entity operating under a similar name.

Mati Greenspan, Senior Market Analyst at social trading marketplace eToro, stated that police in the Tron’s office came to protect the team from angry investors.
