# Major Stablecoin Basis to Close, Return Funds to Investors: Sources ...

###### 2018-12-12 23:12

Major United States-based stablecoin project Basis will shut down operations and return most of its funds to investors, crypto news outlet The Block reports today, Dec. 12.

Citing “multiple people with direct knowledge of the situation,” the reports states that the algorithmic stablecoin project is set to return the majority of the $133 million in funding it raised in a private placement in April.

In private correspondence with Cointelegraph today, Nevin Freeman, co-founder and CEO of competing stablecoin project Reserve, commented that the move is evidently due to regulatory concerns around one of Basis’ token types.

Freeman stated that, as with other algorithmic stablecoins, Basis’ protocol implements a “secondary token,” in this case known as a “bond” token, which needs to be purchased in order for the primary token to keep its stable peg in place.

“In many cases, these secondary ‘share’ or ‘bond’ tokens are securities \[under U.S. law\],” Freeman told Cointelegraph, implying that the “regulatory headwinds” allegedly behind Basis’ decision to shut down come from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Freeman added:

“Since there is only a small set of people who can \[legally\] buy these ‘share’ or ‘bond’ \[unregistered\] security tokens, protocols based on this mechanism may be at risk — if nobody wants to buy these tokens when the stablecoin is trading below the pegged price, the peg will just stay broken.”

Freeman –– whose project also completed a funding round earlier this year, with backing from high profile investors including Peter Thiel, Coinbase and Distributed Global –– also noted that not all algorithmic stablecoins will “suffer the same fate,” continuing, “\[d\]esigns can even include ‘share’ tokens, so long as they aren’t the direct source of capital for purchasing stablecoins out of circulation.”
