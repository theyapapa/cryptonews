The Ethereum Foundation has announced the fourth wave of grants awarded to 20 different persons and entities working on the Ethereum blockchain, it revealed in a press release Oct. 15.

Grant recipients were divided by the manner in which they contributed to the development of the network, such as scalability, usability, and security.

In the announcement, the Ethereum team has also expressed its gratitude to members of community, promising to increase their involvement in the networkâ€™s development:

"Thank you to all the fantastic community members that have applied with creative ideas on how to bolster our ecosystem.

In February 2018, six large-scale blockchain projects created the Ethereum Capital Fund.

OmiseGo, Cosmos, Golem, Maker, Raiden, and Japanese venture capital firm Global Brain announced they would grant a cumulative $100 million to different projects that developed the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem.

Buterin himself also donates money to open-source projects building innovative technologies such as scaling solutions for the Ethereum Blockchain network.

In September 2017, he announced that his advisor shares from OmiseGo and decentralized cryptocurrency exchange Kyber Network would be donated to charity or used to fund Ethereum second-layer infrastructure development.
