Cryptocurrency exchange Huobi’s native Huobi Token (HT) is now available for making real-world online purchases of a wide range of products from the e-commerce platform FomoHunt.

Per a press release shared with Cointelegraph on Aug. 22, users of HT can now purchase clothes, art, hardware and other products from the e-commerce and cryptocurrency industry news platform FomoHunt.

We are working together to allow our community users to use Huobi Token and make real-world purchases for clothes, art, FomoHunt subscriptions, event tickets, and even mining hardware.”

Huobi Token is an Ethereum-based decentralized digital asset with a limited supply of 500 million, which rewards users on the exchange with lowered fees in a bid to increase market share and liquidity on the exchange.

## E-commerce embraces digital tokens

Earlier in August, news broke that privacy-focused cryptocurrency Zcoin became available for spending in Thailand at any merchant registered with the Thai QR code system through Satang App.

The system instantly settles transactions and allows merchants to be paid in Thai Bhat via regulated exchange Satang Pro.

Also this month, South Korean business-to-business fashion platform Sinsang Market joined the Terra Alliance ecosystem, a stablecoin-focused association of large e-commerce companies.
