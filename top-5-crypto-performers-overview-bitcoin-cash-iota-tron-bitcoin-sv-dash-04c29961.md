## BCH/USD

Bitcoin Cash saw massive buying over the week.

However, before the rally began, Bitcoin Cashâ€™s price was overtaken by Ethereum for the first time ever, which shows the kind of damage the bear market and the hard fork had on it.

If the bulls sustain the price above the 20-day EMA, it will increase the probability of a rally to $307.01, which is a 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the fall.

However, if the bears again pounce and sink the price below the 20-day EMA, it can slump back to the lows.

On the other hand, if the price turns down from the current levels, it might find support at the 20-day EMA.

Aggressive buying at lower levels has pushed the price back into the range.

Though the short-term traders can ride this move higher, the investors should wait for a new buy setup to form on the weekly chart before establishing new long positions.
