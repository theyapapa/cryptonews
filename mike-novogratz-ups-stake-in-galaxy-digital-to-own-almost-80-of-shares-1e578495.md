Ex-Goldman Sachs partner Mike Novogratz has increased his shares of Galaxy Digital, the crypto-focused merchant bank he founded, Bloomberg reports on Jan. 2.

Novogratz, who also serves as chief executive officer of the bank, now reportedly owns 221.2 million ordinary shares — which represents about 79.3% of ordinary shares assuming their conversion.

Previously, he reportedly “beneficially owned 213.7 million Class B limited partnership units, representing about 76.6% of ordinary shares assuming conversion.”

According to a statement made Wednesday and reported by Bloomberg, the CEO bought his 7.5 million new shares — which account for 2.7 percent of those issued and outstanding — at a cost of C$7.42 million ($4.8 million).

As reported, Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd. has been listed on Canada’s TSX Venture Exchange as of early August, with trading of the company’s shares getting off to a rocky start.

Markets responded positively to news of the founder’s increased stake, with shares reportedly rising 7.8 percent to C$1.11 as of 10:09 a.m.

As Bloomberg notes, shares in the bank had fallen around 19 percent over 2018 amid the protracted cryptocurrency bear market.
