The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority FINMA has advised banks and other financial institutions to estimate risk coverage for cryptocurrencies at 800 percent of current market value, Cointelegraph auf Deutsch reports today, Nov. 5.

Major local news portal Swissinfo reportedly saw a copy of a confidential letter from FINMA to the Swiss Association for Audit, Tax and Fiduciary (EXPERTsuisse), which explains the watchdog agency’s stance on capital buffers for crypto assets.

In the letter, FINMA recommends financial service providers to allocate a flat risk weight of 800 percent for "to cover market and credit risks, regardless of whether the positions are held in the banking or trading book.”

As Swissinfo reports, a risk weight of 800 percent is at the upper end of the range for financial assets, which suggests that FINMA views the investment as very volatile.

Crypto asset trading is valued by FINMA in a similar fashion to hedge fund activity, despite the sharp drop in crypto prices and subsequent price stability this year.

FINMA also stipulates that cryptocurrencies cannot be considered highly liquid financial assets when determining liquidity ratios i.e. capital that banks can use to offset short-term losses.

At the beginning of October, FINMA awarded the country’s first crypto asset management license to a crypto investment fund.
