# Ethereum Devs Reach Consensus to Delay Constantinople Hard Fork Until January 2019 ...

Ethereum (ETH) core developers have reached a consensus to delay a planned hard fork of the protocol until January 2019, in a meeting Friday, Oct. 19.

The fork, dubbed “Constantinople,” was first trialed on Ethereum public testnet Ropsten on Oct. 13, and had been slated to be activated on the main Ethereum blockchain by the end of Oct.-Nov.

Towards the end of their hour-long meeting yesterday, the devs finally reached a consensus that the Constantinople will at “the earliest” come in late January 2019.

Yesterday’s meeting followed after Constantinople’s debut on Ropsten Oct. 13 had run into a series of hurdles; ahead of its activation at block 4,230,000, the fork stalled at block 4,299,999 for two hours, with testnet miners failing to activate the transition.

Ethereum client developer Alfri Schoeden explained at the time this was due to “a consensus issue” that had triggered a “three-way fork” between Geth and Parity (two Ethereum clients).

In light of the issues, developer Hudson Jameson picked up on another dev’s “good” proposal during yesterday’s meeting, which would be to “regularly spawn and min\[e\] temporary testnets to test transition into Constantinople \[…\].”

As previously reported, the Constantinople hard fork is is a system-wide Ethereum update designed to increase the network’s efficiency, and notably includes plans to reduce block rewards for miners, as well as to introduce changes to the network’s consensus mechanism that would make it more resistant to ASIC miners.
