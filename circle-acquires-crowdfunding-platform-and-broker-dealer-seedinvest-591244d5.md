Cryptocurrency finance company Circle Internet Financial Ltd. has acquired equity crowdfunding platform and broker-dealer SeedInvest, according to an announcement published October 5.

Once the acquisition is approved by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), it will reportedly enable Circle to expand SeedInvest’s offerings to support cryptocurrencies, including fiat stablecoins and issuing and offering tokenized securities.

Additionally, companies will reportedly be able to raise capital through a regulated platform, get access to retail investor portfolios via Circle Invest, and provide investors with secondary market liquidity on Circle’s cryptocurrency exchange.

Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire told Bloomberg in an interview:

“This was a company who had been at the forefront of collaborating with government to figure out how to make it possible to innovate in the way people raise capital.

Earlier this week, Circle launched a new feature for its crypto investment app Circle Invest dubbed “Collections,” that gives customers the option to invest in one or more collections of crypto assets, each divided according to a particular theme: “Platforms, Payments, and Privacy.”

Per Circle, over 20 companies are about to announce support for USDC, while others might add trading through the open ERC-20 standard.

The company offers four products including Circle Pay, which is a fiat money sending service with a social messaging component, and Circle Trade, which is a liquidity provider of cryptocurrencies and reportedly moves over $2 billion each month.
