# How Blockchain May Help the Cobalt in Smartphones and Electric Cars Be Ethically Sourced ...

Blue Hill Mining says its project is based in an “exceptional location” in Mongolia — and that, after eight years of geological planning, research across 10 percent of its surface area has indicated that there are large quantities of copper, nickel, cobalt and gold.

Blue Hill Mining is directly linked to 30 percent ownership of the mine and also has a stake in a peer-to-peer platform designed to connect mining companies, smelters, logistics organizations and multinationals.

In its white paper, Blue Hill Mining says that manufacturers of electric vehicles and smartphones particularly stand to gain from this blockchain-driven project, as they have the potential to save millions of dollars when acquiring the natural resources required to build their products.

## Ethical and transparent

Blue Hill Mining plans to implement blockchain technology throughout its project, delivering transparent data at every stage of the production process.

The Blue Hill Foundation is currently a 24 percent co-owner of the Blue Hill Mine, with a surface area 70 times the size of the principality of Monaco — and it is located in south Mongolia, between the industrial giants China and Russia, its white paper adds.

## Plans for development

Now that an eight-year period of technical exploration has concluded, Blue Hill Mining is intending to become fully licensed under the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority by the end of the year – and aims to encourage mining companies, banks, multinationals and logistics firms to join its blockchain-based commodity trading platform.

Toward the end of 2020, it is hoped that the Blue Hill Mining platform will be “fully operational using blockchain technology,” enabling organizations to ethically source the raw materials they need at a cost that is lower than the market average.
