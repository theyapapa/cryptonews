# TRX, NEO, LINK: Top-3 Crypto Losers of the Week â€” Price Analysis ...

###### 2019-07-27 08:07

The breakdown of this range on November 19 last year did not find sellers at lower levels and the price climbed back into the range on December 21.

## NEO/USD

NEO is the second worst performer among major cryptocurrencies in the past seven days.

However, a look at the chart shows that the NEO/USD pair has held the support at the uptrend line in the current fall.

Since starting the recovery in mid-December of last year, the pair has repeatedly found support at the uptrend line (marked as ellipse on the chart).

We had suggested traders to buy on a breakout of 20-day EMA and the downtrend line in our previous analysis.

Though the price broke out of the downtrend line, it has not been able to scale the 20-day EMA.

Contrary to our assumption, if the price turns down from either 20-day EMA or the top of the range and plummets below $2.0531, it can correct to $1.3202.
