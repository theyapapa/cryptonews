Cryptocurrency exchange Bitstamp has been acquired by Belgium-based investment firm NXMH in an “all cash deal,” Reuters reports today, Oct. 29.

Nejc Kodrič, CEO of the Luxembourg-registered exchange, reportedly revealed the deal had been closed Oct. 25, but declined to share the full terms.

The firm is a subsidiary of Korea-based media giant NXC Corp., which bought a 65.19 percent stake in South Korean crypto exchange Korbit last year.

NXMH now has an 80 percent stake in Bitstamp, with Kodrič retaining his 10 percent ownership interest and staying on as CEO.

NXMH has also reportedly obtained “part” of crypto hedge fund Pantera Capital’s $10 million stake in the exchange, which was acquired in 2014.

Kodrič’s co-founder, Damian Merlak, with whom he started Bitstamp in 2011, has reportedly sold all of his 30 percent stake in the exchange in the NXMH deal.

While Merlak has “not been active since 2015,” according to Kodrič, the two reportedly founded the exchange “out of a Slovenia garage,” with several laptops, one server, and a thousand euros in funds.
