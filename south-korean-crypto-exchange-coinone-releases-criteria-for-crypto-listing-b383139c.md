South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Coinone has released a set of criteria for determining whether to list new digital currency projects on the exchange.

In a blog post published on Aug. 8, Coinone described nine criteria cryptocurrency projects should comply with in order to be listed on the exchange.

Coinone will specifically consider such issues as sustainability of business models, transparency of governance, token distribution plan, vision and value, market size, use case, team formation, roadmap achievement rate and marketability.

## Focus on the South Korean market

In detailing the criteria, Coinone stressed that a crypto project should have a South Korean market-focused business plan, since the majority of its users are local citizens.

Coinone also emphasized that it thoroughly examines the organization of the governance structure of listed projects and associated risks.

Apart from that, Coinone says that it considers a token's future distribution plan, in addition to the projectâ€™s token issuance and circulation.

In April, Coinone announced its plans to expand with the launch of an exchange in Indonesia.
