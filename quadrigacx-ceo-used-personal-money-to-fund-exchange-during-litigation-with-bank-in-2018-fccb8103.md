The late founder of Canadian crypto exchange QuadrigaCX, Gerry Cotten, was purportedly funding the exchange with his own money while it was in litigation with a major Canadian bank.

Cotten’s widow Jennifer Robertson revealed details about the exchange’s financial situation in a statement published on March 13.

The statement reads that Cotten was putting his own money into Quadriga to fund user withdrawals in 2018, after the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) had frozen five accounts holding $21.6 million.

Robertson stated:

“While I had no direct knowledge of how Gerry operated the business, he told me that he had been putting his own money back into QCX to fund user withdrawals in 2018 while the CIBC money remained frozen.

In the recent statement, Robertson also revealed that the legal firm currently representing the exchange will cease its association with Quadriga CX, apparently due to a conflict of interest.

Earlier in March, Robertson asked the court for $225,000 in compensation for legal costs for financing used to help the crypto exchange acquire court-approved protection from creditors.

While the issue of repaying Robertson was reportedly discussed in court, the law firm representing QuadrigaCX’s affected clients, Cox & Palmer argued that repayment should not be granted until Ernst & Young — the court monitor — has reviewed asset and transaction information from Cotten’s estate.
