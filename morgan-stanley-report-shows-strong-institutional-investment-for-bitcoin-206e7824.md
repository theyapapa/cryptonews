# Morgan Stanley Report Shows Strong Institutional Investment for Bitcoin ...

###### 2018-11-06 13:11

On October 31, multinational investment bank and financial services company, Morgan Stanley, released their latest report on Bitcoin.

Morgan Stanley analysts also touched upon the recent stablecoin trend and both central bank and regulator reactions to Bitcoin for the last six months.

In spite of the bank’s apparent readiness to roll out this latest venture, the fact that their list of institutions actually willing to clear Bitcoin futures hasn’t changed since their 2017 report tempers any short-term hope for wider adoption:

## Stablecoin a factor to watch

The report made specific mention of perhaps the most prominent recent development in the cryptocurrency sector: stablecoin.

While emphasising that 54 percent of total cryptocurrency value remains Bitcoin, the report notes how the introduction of stablecoins to the crypto market resulted in a share of trading volumes being siphoned away from BTC.

The report then explains that the resulting slide in Bitcoin prices also had a knock-on effect across the sector, meaning that owners seeking to extricate themselves from Bitcoin holdings needed to find an asset whose valuation more closely reflected the valuation of the U.S. dollar.

While the report does not cast aspersions of the future welfare of any specific stablecoins, it does mention four coins to its readers:

USDT (Tether) receives a mention as being responsible for the initial decrease in BTC trading volumes and for trading at roughly the same price as the U.S. dollar.

## Bitcoin’s “rapidly morphing thesis”

Another key aspect of the Morgan Stanley report is what it calls crypto’s “rapidly morphing thesis.”
