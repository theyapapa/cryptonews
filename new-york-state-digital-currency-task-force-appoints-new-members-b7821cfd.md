Legislators from the New York State Assembly have appointed six members to the New York State Digital Currency Task Force.

In a video announcement on July 22, Assembly member Clyde Vanel announced six appointments to the group, which is tasked with investigating and making regulatory recommendations regarding digital currencies and blockchain technology.

The task force will consist of 13 members, six of whom are appointed by the Assembly, while the remaining seven will be appointed by the governor.

Vanel said, “We are excited that we’re going to have some of the premier people in blockchain technology and in cryptocurrency help guide New York state and the country, and maybe the world, on finding the right level of regulations in this space.

## Group will study blockchain and crypto before making recommendations 

New York state reportedly became the first state in the United States to form its own cryptocurrency task force in January of this year.

The task force was formally created when governor Andrew Cuomo signed the bill dubbed “The Digital Currency Study Bill” into law on Dec. 21, 2018.

The task force of experts will help us strike the balance between having a robust blockchain industry and cryptocurrency economic environment while at the same time protecting New York investors and consumers.”
