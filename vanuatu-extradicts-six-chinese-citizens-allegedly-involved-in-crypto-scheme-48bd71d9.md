The suspects were reportedly arrested in the course of an ongoing investigation of the PlusToken cryptocurrency platform which, according to the Yancheng Public Security Bureau, is a pyramid scheme.

As per the report, the Yancheng police in China have confirmed that they cooperated with local Vanuatu police to extradite six suspects associated with the PlusToken fund.

The individuals were reportedly arrested by Vanuatu authorities at Chinese policeâ€™s request, and later released to China following negotiations.

The case against the PlusToken employees apparently involves widespread investigation, both within and outside China.

The Yancheng Public Security Bureau reportedly learned of the PlusToken situation in early 2019 after receiving word that the PlusToken platform was running a pyramid scheme, which prompted an investigation.

The police said that promoters used the WeChat messaging service to advertise the PlusToken platform; additionally, promotional events including cocktail parties and promotion conferences were held in Beijing, Sanya and Jeju Island, and South Korea.

As per the report, the PlusToken platform reportedly recruited over 100,000 users and raised over $189 million through membership fees between May 2018 and March 2019.
