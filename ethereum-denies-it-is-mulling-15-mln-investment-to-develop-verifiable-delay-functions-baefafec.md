# Ethereum Denies It Is Mulling $15 Mln Investment to Develop Verifiable Delay Functions ...

The Ethereum Foundation has refuted alleged plans to spend a prospective $15 million on the development of Verifiable Delay Functions (VDFs) for use in its transition to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) network.

A report from crypto news outlet CoinDesk had purported that the Foundation was considering an investment of $15 million to develop the technology, given its prospective benefit for Ethereum’s future transition to a PoS-based system.

Drake however told Cointelegraph in an email that:

“The EF \[Ethereum Foundation\] is not looking to spend $15m.

In the context of a blockchain that uses a PoS consensus algorithm, a function such as a VDF can be important in order to thwart the possibility that a network participant may influence or predict randomness in order to manipulate which leaders and validators will be elected through the protocol.

As reported, the shift to PoS is expected to be completed with the final upgrade of the Ethereum network — known as Serenity, or Ethereum 2.0 — which will be the last in a series of four stages set out in the platform’s roadmap.

At present, the network is in its third stage (Metropolis), which consists of two system-wide hard forks — Byzantium and Constantinople — both designed to pave the way to Ethereum 2.0.

Earlier this month, Ethereum launched its first pre-release for phase zero of the network’s evolving transition to Serenity, which co-founder Vitalik Buterin proposed was “\*baaasically\* feature complete for Casper” — a transitional PoS-Proof-of-Work (PoW) hybrid consensus model currently under development by the Foundation.
