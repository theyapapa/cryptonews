# Egypt Lays Out Path for a Crypto Future With Draft Law ...

Since then, the financial situation in the country continued to deteriorate, and just a month after the announcement, in August 2017, news surfaced that Egypt would be getting its first crypto exchange — i.e., Yellow — which was supposed to start trading in September 2017.

The exchange was supposed to be the first service where the Egyptian pound could be exchanged for digital currencies in a bitcoin\\pound trading pair, without the use of other currencies like the United States dollar.

There were claims that Egypt believed that the digital version of its blockchain-based paper currency could help to minimize the government’s expenses on issuing paper money and transactions compared to coins and bank notes, which was the first step toward a cashless society.

Cryptocurrencies can potentially do much for countries like Egypt, but the country has serious problems with trust in digital assets, given their volatility and the alleged connection with money laundering and related criminal activities.”

According to him, however, the position is understandable, as Egypt was trying to mitigate the risks of dealing with an unknown technology, but the positive fact was that the country has been looking at cryptocurrencies for a couple of years, which suggests that the government had enough time for an in-depth study of crypto technology.

Mazaev went on to add:

“Egypt has traditionally taken a highly risk-averse stance to decentralized cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, stepping up its public rhetoric since the country’s first crypto exchange in August 2017.”

The government was possibly studying how other progressive countries, such as the UAE, successfully issued licenses for cryptocurrencies exchanges, which ensured the security of digital assets.
