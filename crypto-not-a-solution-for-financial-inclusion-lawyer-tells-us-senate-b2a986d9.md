# Crypto Not a Solution for Financial Inclusion, Lawyer Tells US Senate ...

###### 2019-07-30 08:07

In a prepared statement for today’s United States Senate’s crypto hearing by international lawyer Mehrsa Baradaran, suggests that cryptos are not the solution for financial inclusion and equity in banking.

## Policy, not technology is the solution

In her statement, published on the Senate’s website, Baradaran explains that the issues of inequality and inefficiency in finance that Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies are trying to solve should be resolved through policy, not technology.

She concludes:

“While I share many of the cryptocurrency industry’s concerns with respect to failures of the banking industry, I do not believe cryptocurrency is the best solution to the problems of financial inclusion and equity in banking.”

## The Fed will protect its influence

In response, senior market analyst at eToro, Mati Greenspa, pointed out that the Federal Reserve is incentivized to keep its power, not to increase financial inclusion, and no amount of lobbying can change this.

By supporting bitcoin or other independent forms of money, they will be forced to compete with it.

Only then will you get the inclusion you seek.

As Cointelegraph reported earlier today, Circle co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire is scheduled to testify before Congress today as a representative of The Blockchain Association — a business organization comprised of blockchain industry advocates.
