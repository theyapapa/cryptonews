# UK’s Tax Authority Requests User Data From Crypto Exchanges: Report ...

###### 2019-08-06 12:08

The United Kingdom’s tax, payments and customs authority Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs (HMRC) has reportedly requested that digital currency exchanges provide it with information about customers’ names and transactions aiming to identify cases of tax evasion.

## Crypto exchanges come under fire

According to fintech-focused media outlet Coindesk, industry sources said that the agency has sent letters to at least three crypto exchanges in the U.K., including Coinbase, eToro, and CEX.io, requesting that they provide lists of users and transaction data.

HMRC is reportedly aiming to cooperate with crypto exchanges in a bid to identify individuals who evade taxes.

HMRC reportedly confirmed that such requests are within the scope of its competence, specifically claiming:

“These exchanges can retain information on their clients and the transactions that they have completed.

These transactions may result in potential tax charges and HMRC has the power to issue notices requiring exchanges to provide this information.”

## Matter of international significance

HMRC’s move echoes the United States Internal Revenue Service’s, when it sent letters to 10,000 crypto investors, asking some to amend their tax filings, while compelling others to pay back taxes and/or interest and penalties.

Cointelegraph reported that beginning Aug. 1, Brazil citizens are obligated to report on their crypto transactions with the country’s tax authority, the Department of Federal Revenue.
