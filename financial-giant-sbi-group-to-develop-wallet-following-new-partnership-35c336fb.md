Japan-based financial services firm SBI Group and Danish cryptography services company Sepior ApS have partnered to jointly develop a proprietary wallet, according to an announcement published Oct. 13.

The wallet is set to ensure secure transactions on SBI’s cryptocurrencies exchange platform, VCTRADE.

The SBI Group was established in 1999 in Japan as an Internet-based financial services provider.

Per the press release, Sepior and SBI have signed an agreement to license Sepior’s Threshold-Sig Wallet Security technology and to jointly develop a proprietary wallet to secure online content and transactions on SBI’s digital currencies trading platform, VCTRADE.

Sepior’s patented Threshold Wallet technology reportedly allows faster signing of transactions involving multiple parties and “eliminates the need for any device or entity to possess the entire private key at any time, making it effectively impossible for an attack to result in key theft.”

Yoshitaka Kitao, Representative Director, President and CEO of SBI Holdings commented on the technology:

“After extensive investigation, our security research team determined threshold signatures based on multiparty computation (MPC) offered our desired level of security, performance, and scalability needed to manage transactions for our growing SBI Virtual Currencies customer base.”

In the trial, SBI Group employees will reportedly use the S Coin platform to complete cash-free purchases at cafes and eateries around the premises of the SBI headquarters.
