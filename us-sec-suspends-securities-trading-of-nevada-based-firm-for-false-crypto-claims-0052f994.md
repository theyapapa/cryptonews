The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has suspended securities trading of a Nevada-based firm for making false claims that its cryptocurrency trading activities were approved by the SEC, according to an announcement published Oct. 22.

Per the SEC’s order, in August 2018 American Retail Group, Inc. aka Simex Inc. published two press releases stating that the company had partnered with a custodian qualified with the SEC.

American Retail Group also stated in the releases that it was conducting a token offering, that was “officially registered in accordance \[with\] SEC requirements.”

In response to the company’s statements, Robert A. Cohen, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division’s Cyber Unit, said that “the SEC does not endorse or qualify custodians for cryptocurrency, and investors should use vigilance when considering an investment in an Initial Coin Offering (ICO).”

The SEC noted that under federal securities laws, the regulator can suspend securities trading for 10 days, as well as ban a broker-dealer from soliciting investors to purchase and sell the stock until compliance with certain requirements is met.

“Federal government agencies, including the SEC and CFTC \[Commodity Futures Trading Commission\], do not endorse or sponsor any particular securities, issuers, products, services, professional credentials, firms, or individuals,” the warning reads.

One of the alleged companies, Advertiza Holdings (Pty) Ltd. falsely claimed to be registered with the SEC and was also not registered to sell securities in North Dakota.
