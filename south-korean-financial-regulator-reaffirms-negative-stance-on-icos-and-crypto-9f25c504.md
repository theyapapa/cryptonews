The chairman of Korea’s Financial Services Commission Choi Jong-koo has reaffirmed his negative position on digital currencies and Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), Business Korea reported Oct. 11.

This August, Korean lawmakers, including participants from government ministries, returned to the cryptocurrency issue, focusing on repealing the country's ICO ban.

At the recent session, Choi reportedly said that “the government does not deny the potential of the blockchain industry," while noting that it “should not equate the cryptocurrency trading business with the blockchain industry.”

Choi said:

"Many people say the Korean government should allow ICOs, but ICOs bring uncertainty and the damage they can cause is too serious and obvious.

Other officials have said that the South Korean government is “likely” to announce its official position on ICOs in November.

Hong told Korean business publication the Investor that the government launched a survey of blockchain companies to gather their views on the current legal framework.

In September, South Korean cabinet ministers agreed to exclude all sale and brokerage of digital assets based on blockchain technology from venture business classification.
