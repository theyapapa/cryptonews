Leading U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has started listing 0x (ZRX) token, according to an announcement published Oct. 11.

The move marks the first time Coinbase has added support for an ERC-20 token.

Per the announcement, Coinbase has launched support for ZRX on its professional platform, Coinbase Pro, although trading will only be allowed once sufficient liquidity is established.

ZRX trading will be available in most jurisdictions, except the state of New York during its initial launch stage.

Coinbase has divided the launch into four independent stages for each new trading pair; ZRX/USD, ZRX/EUR and ZRX/BTC, while the exchange notes that currently it will not offer trading on the ZRX/GBP pair.

As Coinbase states in the blog post, in the first, “transfer-only” stage, customers will be able to transfer ZRX into their Coinbase Pro accounts, without an option to place orders.

In July, Coinbase announced its was considering adding five new assets — Cardano (ADA), Basic Attention Token (BAT), Stellar Lumens (XLM), Zcash (ZEC), and ZRX — to its trading list.
