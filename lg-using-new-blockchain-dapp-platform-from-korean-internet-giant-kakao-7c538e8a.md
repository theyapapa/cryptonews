Ground X, the blockchain arm of South Korean tech giant Kakao, has launched the mainnet of its Klaytn platform, The Korea Herald reported on June 27.

It is hoped that the platform, which focuses on decentralized apps (DApps,) will drive blockchain adoption in the country.

Han Jae-sun, Ground X’s chief executive, said the firms using Klaytn have a combined market value of $64.8 billion.

By October, Kakao hopes to have 34 DApps available.

The launch is significant because of Kakao’s dominance in South Korea, where it has a 96% market share.

Last month, reports suggested that the company was planning to release an integrated crypto wallet in its KakaoTalk messaging app once the Klaytn mainnet had launched.

A testnet for Klaytn was unveiled back in October, and at the time, 10 domestic and international companies were involved in experimenting with the new ecosystem.
