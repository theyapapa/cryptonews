# Bitfury Brings Lightning Payments to US Payment Gateway HadePay ...

Bitcoin (BTC) mining and development company Bitfury has entered into a partnership with United States payments processor startup HadePay to allow its merchants to accept Lightning Network (LN) transactions.

HadePay implemented Bitfury’s Lightning Peach API to facilitate LN payments, which are significantly faster and cheaper than conventional Bitcoin transactions.

The startup worked with Bitfury’s Lightning Peach team, a dedicated spin-off group of engineers focused on Lightning Network promotion.

As a payments gateway, HadePay already lets clients accept crypto and fiat currencies as well as payments via various services, such as PayPal and Square.

“HadePay’s wide network will now be able to accept bitcoin knowing that the transaction will go through almost immediately,” Lightning Peach head Pavel Prikhodko commented in the blog post, adding:

“The Lightning Network is an essential tool for efficient cryptocurrency payments, and we’re thrilled to be bringing it that much closer to worldwide adoption.”

As Cointelegraph reported, the technology is seeing heightened publicity in 2019, mostly due to the ongoing Lightning Torch transaction relay experiment.

Passed between network participants, the Torch has seen ownership from figures including Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, who subsequently pledged to implement LN payments on both Twitter and payments platform Square.
