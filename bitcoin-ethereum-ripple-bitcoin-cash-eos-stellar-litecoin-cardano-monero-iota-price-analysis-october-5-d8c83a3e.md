###### 2018-10-05 17:10

## BTC/USD

The bears did not take advantage of the breakdown below the trendline and Bitcoin has bounced back above the 20-day EMA.

## BCH/USD

Bitcoin Cash has been holding above the 20-day EMA for the past two days but the bulls have not been able to push prices higher.

As the BCH/USD pair is holding above the 20-day EMA, we suggest traders hold their long position with the stops at $400.

## XLM/USD

Stellar has held the 20-day EMA for the past two days but has not been able to close (UTC time frame) above $0.24987525.

## ADA/USD

Cardano broke below the 20-day EMA on Oct. 2, but the bears have not been able to push prices to the lower support at $0.071355.

The flat moving averages and the RSI close to the 50 level shows equilibrium between the bulls and the bears.

Both moving averages are flat and the RSI is close to the 50 level, which suggests that lackluster trading action might continue for a few more days.
