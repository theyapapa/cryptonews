# Canadian Town Says Yes to Accepting Bitcoin for Property Taxes ...

###### 2019-07-16 05:07

Canadian crypto solutions provider and trading platform operator Coinberry has struck its second municipal partnership to provide Bitcoin payments processing for property taxes.

A press release published on July 15 revealed that Coinberry has begun negotiations with the City of Richmond Hill in the Greater Toronto Area after the Council voted on July 10 in favor of cementing an agreement with Coinberry to support Bitcoin (BTC) property tax payments for residents and firms in its jurisdiction.

The partnership represents Coinberry’s second municipal foray in less than six months, with the firm previously having implemented a crypto payments service with the Town of Innisfil, also in the Greater Toronto Area.

Coinberry is a Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC)-registered firm and has been converting multiple cryptocurrencies into Canadian dollars to settle property tax payments with Innisfil, meaning that the municipality itself does not hold crypto directly.

Once negotiations have been finalized, City of Richmond Hill municipal staff are expected to report back on the likelihood they will be able to implement Coinberry’s technology for additional payments of other City fees and broaden services as soon as September 30.

According to the press release, the Council’s affirmative vote in favor of crypto payments means that the City of Richmond Hill’s City Manager is legally authorized to enter into a contract with Coinberry as soon as negotiations are complete.

Our Council was aware of Coinberry's successful implementation of a digital currency payment service with the Town of Innisfil, and since there was no cost and no risk to \[...\] do the same, it made the decision that much easier for us."
