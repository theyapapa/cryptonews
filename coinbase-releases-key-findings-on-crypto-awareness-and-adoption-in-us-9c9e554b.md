Major American cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase released key findings about awareness and adoption trends related to digital currency in the United States in a blog post published on June 28.

Coinbaseâ€™s survey that spans the past year and 2,000 participants revealed that cryptocurrency awareness in the U.S. has continued growing, with 58% of Americans having heard about bitcoin (BTC).

The top 10 states with the highest crypto ownership are California, New Jersey, Washington, New York, Colorado, Utah, Florida, Alaska, Nevada, and Massachusetts.

States such as Delaware, Nevada, and Wyoming have a lower overall percentage of crypto owners, but a higher per-capita ownership, meaning a smaller number of people hold a larger than average amount of crypto each.

When asked about what drove them to purchase cryptocurrency, respondents recalled the investment opportunity presented by crypto, interest in new technology, and ability to educate themselves about it among the major reasons.

Thus, as of June 2019, over 70% of U.S. states have reportedly enacted regulations pertaining to crypto or blockchain.

The proportion of people who heard of bitcoin increased from 77% in October 2017 to 89% in April 2019.
