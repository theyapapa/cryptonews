Australia has unveiled a national blockchain strategy and roadmap, with a boost of AU$100,000 (~$71,200) in further funding from the federal government.

Minister for Industry, Science and Technology Karen Andrews and Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment Simon Birmingham have jointly stated that the new policy roadmap aims to make Australia’s nascent blockchain industry into a global leader.

According to the media release, previous blockchain investments from Australia’s liberal national government — under Prime Minister Scott Morrison — have included AU$700,000 (~$500,000) to the country’s Digital Transformation Agency in 2018-19 explore the benefits of using blockchain for government payments, as well as AU$350,000 (~$250,000) to Standards Australia to promote the development of standardized international blockchain standards.

This fresh funding will specifically enable the Ministry for Industry, Science and Technology to sponsor Australian companies to join the Australian Trade and Investment Commission (Austrade)’s mission to the Consensus blockchain conference in New York City later this year.

Minister Andrews has outlined that they “will work closely with blockchain and technology experts from industry and academia \[...\] as well as with CSIRO’s Data61 to incorporate findings from their forthcoming future scenarios report on blockchain.”

In the media release, Minister Birmingham emphasized that the government’s blockchain endorsement will help ensure that “Australia and \[its\] tech companies stay ahead of the game in one of the world’s fastest growing technology sectors.”

In July 2018, IBM signed a five-year AU$1 billion ($740 million) deal with the Australian government to use blockchain and other new technologies to improve data security and automation across federal departments.
