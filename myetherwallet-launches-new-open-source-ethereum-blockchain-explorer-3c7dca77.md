###### 2019-03-12 07:03

Major Ethereum (ETH) wallet provider MyEtherWallet (MEW) has announced the launch of the alpha version of its new open source Ethereum blockchain explorer, EthVM, in a tweet from the official MEW Twitter account on March 11.

The current version of EthVM shows data from the Ropsten network, an Ethereum testnet.

Once deployed on Ethereum’s main network (mainnet), EthVM will be competing with Etherscan, the current leading Ethereum block explorer.

In the tweet announcing the news, MEW asked users to report their feedback on the tool, stating:

“Keep in mind that it's still in Alpha – please report any issues and suggestions, and help us improve the platform!”

As Cointelegraph reported at the beginning of February, users of cryptocurrency wallets MEW and Electrum are currently facing phishing attacks.

By analyzing the Ethereum chain, recent research showed that over 80 percent of the total circulating supply of Ethereum is held by 7,572 addresses.

The same report also claims that the price of ETH has dropped an average of 19 percent after each of the past five hard forks, over the following 30 days.
