Japanese startup Connectome have come up with the “world’s first” Virtual Human Agent (VHA) on the blockchain.

## Artificial agents for sale

Japanese startup Connectome saw an opportunity in the market to make this dream a reality.

Connectome foresees a rapidly growing trend to replace user interfaces with human-like AI agents, similar to the rush of automotive companies that replaced animal-driven vehicles in a blink of an eye, at the turn of the 20th century.

The company is working closely with Couger, a Japanese technology firm with 12 years expertise in various blockchain, AI, AR/VR -related projects.

Connectome’s blockchain platform will facilitate thousands of developers and entrepreneurs to exchange and trade the human-like AI agents they develop, and the data needed to train them, the company says.

Further, Connectome’s platform will enable people and companies to have a method of securing ownership and other rights on human-like AI agents.

## Out of the crowd

Connectome’s management thinks that the company stays out of the crowd in the blockchain industry, probably implying its attractiveness as a target for investment.
