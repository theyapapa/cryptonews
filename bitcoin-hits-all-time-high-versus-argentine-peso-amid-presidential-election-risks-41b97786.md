The biggest cryptocurrency, bitcoin (BTC), has hit an all-time high versus the Argentine peso amid the ongoing decline of the currency, Financial Times (FT) reports on May 27.

According to the report, the bitcoin price has soared to as high as 394,000 pesos ($8,762.95 at press time) per coin, exceeding prices versus the Argentine peso not seen since the bubble in late 2017.

The new all-time high of bitcoin versus the peso takes place amid a crypto bull market this year, along with the ongoing depreciation of the Argentine peso against the U.S. dollar.

According to CNBC charts, the U.S. dollar has seen a massive growth over the peso during the past year.

As FT noted, the peso dropped to new lows against the dollar in April, following a loss of more than half of its value last year, when both the peso and Turkish lira dropped amid investor expectations of rising U.S. rates.
