# New Platform Enables Trades Across 200 Tools and Runs Educational Crypto Show ...

###### 2019-02-11 06:02

A cross-market platform called LH-Crypto says its service gives traders the opportunity to transact across a plethora of cryptocurrencies and 200 other financial instruments — including forex on fiat currencies, precious metals, shares and commodities.

Its beta version also enables users to participate in margin trading — a feature that it says helps distinguish its ecosystem from crypto exchanges.

Not without risks, margin trading via LH-Crypto means members can make deals using sums 100 times larger than their account balance.

Traders can receive funds in cryptocurrencies or fiat — and if they top up their account using traditional currencies, this cash can be automatically converted into the crypto asset of their choosing.

## Four tiers of membership

In an attempt to appeal to crypto traders of varying experience levels and budgets, the team at LH-Crypto has devised four tiers of membership.

LH-Crypto’s website is also home to a forum where like-minded traders can discuss issues surrounding cryptocurrencies, exchanges, forex and the company itself.

## Keeping crypto traders updated

As well as offering its community regular updates on the new features being added to its platform, LH-Crypto’s website acts as a hub for news on cryptocurrencies and the global economy, giving traders intelligence to help them make informed decisions.
