Sunday, Nov. 18: after a tumultuous week, the crypto markets are today signalling recovery, with most of the top ten cryptocurrencies seeing healthy growth of within a 1 to 7 percent range, and the vast majority of the top 100 crypto assets by market cap in the green, as data from Coin360 shows.

After a steep decline Nov. 14, Bitcoin (BTC) is today showing signs of gentle growth, consolidating its incremental gains in recent days to push the $5,600 price point.

While many have attributed this week’s market tumble to the impact of the contentious Bitcoin Cash (BCH) hard fork Nov.15, some Bloomberg analysts even have gone so far as to forecast that the hard fork fallout, coupled with the “enduring \[crypto\] bear market,” could mean Bitcoin might tumble as low as $1,500.

Ethereum (ETH) has seen mild growth and is up 1.3 percent on the day to trade at $175.

As of Nov. 14, Ethereum’s losses have been even more drastic than Bitcoin’s, with the altcoin now down over 16 percent on its weekly chart.

The remaining coins in the top twenty by market cap unanimously green, mostly seeing growth capped within a 3 percent range.

Total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies is around $186 billion as of press time, up from an intra-week low at around $175 billion Nov. 15, but almost 12 percent down from $211 billion at the start of its weekly chart.
