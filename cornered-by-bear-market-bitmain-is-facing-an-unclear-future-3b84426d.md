# Cornered by Bear Market, Bitmain Is Facing an Unclear Future ...

###### 2019-01-13 08:01

On Jan. 10, news emerged that Chinese Bitcoin mining giant Bitmain’s co-founders, Jihan Wu and Micree Zhan Ketuan, will step down as co-CEOs of the company.

## Brief introduction to Bitmain, the world’s most powerful crypto mining giant

Bitmain was founded in 2013 by Jihan Wu and Micree Zhan Ketuan.

## Current state of affairs: Bear market-induced losses

As of January 2019, the two mining pools operated by Bitmain, AntPool and BTC.com, contribute to almost 23 percent of the total hashing power of the entire Bitcoin mining pool.

However, when the full-blown bear market hit in November, and the price of Bitcoin fell below the breakeven cost of mining of $6,900, Bitmain should have started to experience harsher financial difficulties due to lesser demand for mining devices.

Thus, on Jan. 10, SCMP wrote that both Bitmain’s co-founders, Jihan Wu and Micree Zhan Ketuan, will quit their posts as co-CEOs, but still steer the company’s important decisions.

## Bitmain IPO plans become doubtful as well

In June 2018, media started to report that Jihan Wu was planning to conduct an overseas IPO in a market with United States dollar denominated shares — like Hong Kong — as it would allow early backers to cash in funds.

Later in July, a research unit for crypto exchange BitMEX analyzed alleged leaked data on Bitmain’s potential IPO and stated that the mining giant had conducted a pre-IPO round that reportedly raised around $14 billion, leading them to believe that it could raise no less than $20 billion at the IPO stage.
