# Wine, Mountains, and Mining Rigs: Georgia as a Crypto Powerhouse ...

A single entity, the US-based blockchain software and hardware provider Bitfury, is responsible for much of Georgia’s current crypto momentum.

Vavilov first arrived in Georgia to talk business in 2013; in July 2014, Bitfury’s first 20 megawatt data center emerged in the eastern Georgian city of Gori.

In December of the following year, a major expansion nearly tripled the company’s mining capacity in the country, as Bitfury deployed its 16 nm ASIC chips at a new facility in the area called Gldani, within the capital Tbilisi city limits.

In February 2018, Bitfury announced that it was selling the Gldani data center to Chong Sing Holdings, a Hong-Kong based fintech company, citing the need to continue its “successful expansion in the Asian market of both hardware and software solutions.”

## The Bitcoin dream

Whether it was due to Bitfury raising the profile of the mining enterprise or people being able to figure it out regardless, the ordinary Georgians have had their fair share of the crypto craze.

The nation’s Bitcoin exuberance at the peak of the Great Bull Run was understandable: it seemed that the combination of the state’s openness to crypto and cheap electricity available across the board was going to bring about prosperity.

It is now incumbent upon the nation’s policymakers and industry leaders to make sure that Georgia grows from being a mining hub to a dynamic center of fintech innovation, where a host of smaller firms compete do deliver consumer-oriented technologies and solutions.
