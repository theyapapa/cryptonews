Cryptocurrency exchange and custodian Gemini Trust Company, LLC (Gemini) has secured insurance coverage for custodied digital assets from lending services firm Aon, according to a press release published Oct. 3.

Founded in 2014 in New York by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, Gemini is now the 50th largest digital currency exchange by 24 hour adjusted trade volume, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Per the press release, Gemini’s digital insurance coverage will complement the already available Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)-insured U.S. dollar deposits.

Last month, Gemini exchange announced that former Chief Information Officer of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Robert Cornish had joined the company.

At Gemini, Cornish is responsible for leading technology initiatives and monitoring the deployment of Nasdaq’s SMARTS Market Surveillance technology, which will let Gemini control all of its order books and Gemini Auctions.

In April, Gemini revealed that it would begin offering crypto block trading outside of their regular order books.

In December last year, Gemini partnered with the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) to launch Bitcoin (BTC) futures, which let them bring the traditional market instruments into the crypto space.
