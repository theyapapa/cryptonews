# Bart Chilton: Former CFTC Regulator, Crypto Holder and ICO Endorser ...

Last weekend, Bart Chilton, a former commissioner of the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and early advocate for cryptocurrency regulation, died at the age of 58.

In 2007, Chilton was nominated to be a CFTC commissioner by President Bush, and his position was subsequently confirmed by the Senate.

Although Chilton has said that he’s been calling for cryptocurrency regulation since 2012, he never addressed the topic during his congressional speeches while working for the CFTC, as per the agency’s database.

Further on in the interview, Chilton argued that cryptocurrency holders “were losing actual money on this \[bitcoin\],” to support his viewpoint.

In 2016, however, Chilton (no longer a CFTC commissioner) wrote a commentary for CNBC in which he called the bitcoin and blockchain industry “disruptive,” and argued that President Obama should ensure that its growth is not damaged by overly tight regulations, comparing it to the early IT-industry:

“When the internet was being developed, an effort and initiative by the Clinton administration to ensure that the fledgling idea would not be overly regulated was put in place — the 1997 Framework for Global Electronic Commerce.

In September 2017, Chilton highlighted bitcoin’s volatility as a major issue, saying that he would have started a probe into potential market manipulation if he still worked at the CFTC at the time.

In his latest articles, Chilton argued that the industry is becoming more civilized — futures trading on regulated exchanges like CBOE and CME, as well as Bakkt’s potential arrival were mentioned as examples — which, along with the massive price crackdown, are good developments for the market.
