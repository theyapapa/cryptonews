Major cryptocurrency exchange Binance is apparently testing a British pound stablecoin on its native blockchain, Binance Chain, according to a Twitter post on June 3.

Twitter user CryptosBatman noticed that the listing “$BGBP” appeared on the Binance platform.

Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao has commented on the tweet, confirming that a pound stablecoin is in the testing phase, with only £200 minted.

Zhao came under fire last month for posting about potentially rolling back transactions (re-org) on the exchange after a $40 million hack.

As recently reported by Cointelegraph, Binance’s decentralized exchange (DEX) website will geoblock users in the United States and 28 other countries starting in July.

A pop-up on the website notes that attempting to access Binanace by its website will not be possible for users with an IP address associated with one of the banned countries; however, users can still avail themselves of wallets that support Binance Chain (BNB) for using Binance DEX.
