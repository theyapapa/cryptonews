# AI-Driven Platform ‘Outperformed Stock Markets’ – And Now, It Is Focusing On Crypto ...

###### 2018-10-16 10:10

Rise, which was founded in 2012, is planning to adapt its artificial intelligence (AI) trading technology to the cryptocurrency markets – enabling users to manage their investments and trade across dozens of exchanges.

Its white paper explains: “The playing field is being leveled for all who join Rise, as well as bolstering the cryptocurrency market itself with data-driven investment strategies that are free of emotional human bias, ignore hype, and avoid the pump-and-dump marketing or boom-and-bust cycles that inevitably bring unnecessary risk to the market.”

Rise also believes that time is running out for regular human traders who are looking to make a profit from cryptocurrencies.

## How its format works

The firm is now launching the Rise token, which it describes as the entrance point for its ecosystem.

According to the company, token holders will be able to “access award-winning technology,” but as part of the company’s business model, they will also be profit participants – sharing 20 percent of the revenues that Rise accrues by licensing its technology to banks and third-party funds.

Users will also directly receive returns generated by Rise algorithms, the company says.

Following the end of the security token offering (STO), a full version of the Rise app – complete with all trading features – is set to launch in the first quarter of 2019.
