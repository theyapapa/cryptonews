###### 2019-02-26 20:02

Japanese multinational conglomerate Sony and IT equipment services firm Fujitsu have created an encrypted database for educational proficiency documents, The Asahi Shimbun reports on Feb. 26.

The database, which reportedly employs blockchain technology, is used to prevent forgeries of language proficiency documents, which some foreigners purportedly use to receive resident status to study in Japan.

Foreigners must submit a Japanese language proficiency certificate to the Immigration Bureau in order to receive resident status to study in Japan.

Japanese language schools within the country will submit the certificates on behalf of institutions overseas.

The two firms created the platform by combining Fujitsuâ€™s online learning system with a blockchain developed by Sony subsidiary Sony Global Education Inc.

In using the platform, Japanese language schools can compare certificates with data registered on the blockchain in order to verify that the documents are authentic.

The trial will take place at at Human Academy Co., which runs Japanese language schools in the cities of Osaka, Saga and Tokyo.
