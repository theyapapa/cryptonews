American entrepreneur and Democratic 2020 presidential candidate Andrew Yang has said that blockchain should be a big part of the United States’ future, Bloomberg reported on May 15.

Speaking at the Consensus conference in New York, Yang — who is well known for his progressive pro-universal basic income stance — reportedly stated that:

“I believe that blockchain needs to be a big part of our future.

In April, he published a national framework for digital assets regulation as part of his presidential campaign, and has advocated for more clarity in regard to the overlapping jurisdictions of federal regulatory agencies.

In an interview with Bloomberg during the conference, Yang reportedly stated that he would base his consumer protection digital asset framework loosely upon existing securities laws, adding that:

“We just need to provide rules of the road.

Bloomberg notes that Yang nonetheless does not own cryptocurrencies himself, although he has reportedly confirmed that he has invested in at least one vehicle that does have crypto holdings.

Yang’s campaign has also accepted bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and other cryptocurrency donations as of July 2018.

As Cointelegraph reported, Yang’s position marks a stark contrast to fellow 2020 contender, senator Elizabeth Warren — a staunch critic of cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings.
