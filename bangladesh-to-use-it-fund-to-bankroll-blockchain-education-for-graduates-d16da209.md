The Bangladesh government will use money from its $208 million IT project fund to send graduates for blockchain training in Japan and India.

Bangladesh authorities plan to send 100 new IT graduates abroad to boost expertise in the fields of distributed ledger technology, artificial intelligence, machine learning and cyber security, Bangladesh’s English-language newspaper The Daily Star reports Aug. 4.

As a part of the initiative, the government will also send 200 graduates of computer science and software, electrical and electronic engineering to learn about future trends of information technology, the report notes.

Per the report, the program will be bankrolled by a governmental fund created in association with an Indian line of credit to establish 12 district ICT and hi-tech parks.

In June, the Canada-based University of British Columbia announced a blockchain and distributed ledger technology training program for Master’s and PhD students.

Last week, Ripple partnered with Kyoto University and the University of Tokyo as part of its University Blockchain Research Initiative.

The University of Tokyo will award scholarships to students doing blockchain research, while its economics department arranges seminars on blockchain and settlement.
