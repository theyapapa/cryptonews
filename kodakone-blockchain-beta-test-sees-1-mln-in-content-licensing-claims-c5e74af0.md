KodakONE — the developer of a blockchain-based image rights platform licensed by photographic industry giant Kodak — has reportedly generated over $1 million in licensing claims for image rights during a limited beta test of its platform.

As Cointelegraph previously reported, the KodakONE Image Rights Management Platform is an image copyright protection, monetization and distribution platform secured via blockchain.

RYDE, together with ICOx Innovations, has overseen the design and development of the KodakONE Platform and its KodakCoin token.

The KodakONE platform, meanwhile, uses a hybrid blockchain infrastructure with Ethereum, Stellar and Hyperledger technology.

This October, KodakOne launched its beta Post-Licensing Portal (PLP), which uses an intelligent web crawler and image recognition technology to enable rights holders to track their images and rights infringements.

Artificial intelligence (AI) technology enriches image data and can predict licensing value based on similar registered images, with the platform also allowing rights holders to license image usagee retroactively, in a bid to turn infringers into lawful customers.

KodakONE co-founder Cam Chell told Breaker Mag that within the current photographic industry, even professionals are only managing to collect licensing fees from 20 percent of the market at most, due to the prohibitive costs of manual management.
