# Report: E\*Trade Prepares to Offer Crypto Trading ...

Online trading firm E\*Trade Financial Group is preparing to offer cryptocurrency trading on its platform, sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg on April 26.

E\*Trade will reportedly begin by offering bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) after which it will add other cryptocurrencies.

As one of the largest online trading platforms, E\*Trade offering cryptocurrency trading could represent a significant step forward for cryptocurrency adoption.

Per the firmâ€™s annual report filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Dec. 31, 2018, E\*Trade had 4.9 million brokerage accounts and a total margin receivables balance of $9.6 billion.

Should E\*Trade offer cryptocurrency trading, it would join other online securities trading platforms like Robinhood, which have also stepped into the cryptocurrency space.

In May 2018, Robinhood briefly overtook E\*Trade in the number of trading accounts on the platform.

Some analysts have recently said that cryptocurrency represents a sound long-term investment for institutional investors.
