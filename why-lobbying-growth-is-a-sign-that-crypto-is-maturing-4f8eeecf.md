# Why Lobbying Growth Is a Sign That Crypto Is Maturing ...

Its statistics revealed that the number of companies and organizations lobbying for crypto had increased between Q4 2018 and Q1 2019, with lobbying efforts from the likes of Mastercard, Accenture and EY underlining how the regulatory fate of blockchain and cryptocurrencies isn't of interest only to Coinbase, Coin Center and other representatives of the crypto industry.

It's encouraging that more companies are involving themselves in the issue of cryptocurrency regulation, since, if nothing else, this growth indicates that such regulation is more likely to be drafted in accordance with the views and interests of the organizations that actually have a stake in crypto.

As for which organizations are the biggest spenders, it's perhaps not surprising to learn that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce spent almost $16.5 million lobbying Congress in the first quarter of the year, although it's safe to assume that most of this wasn't lavished specifically on blockchain- and crypto-related issues.

Still, the lobbying group — to which around 300,000 businesses belong as members — did declare in its quarterly report that one of its many specific issues was "draft legislation on cryptocurrencies," while another was "blockchain and fintech."

After the Chamber of Commerce, the next biggest spender with an interest in either blockchain or crypto was the National Association of Manufacturers, which had $2.3 million to spend on lobbying in the first quarter of 2019.

As the first of its two reports for the quarter disclosed, one of its interests was blockchain — and in particular, the need for Congress to arrive at a legally conclusive definition of blockchain technology, as suggested by its lobbying on the Blockchain Promotion Act.

And much like IBM, it also lobbied on the same Blockchain Promotion Act, once more indicating that there are a growing number of companies that are desperate for the U.S. government and regulators to settle on clear regulation, standards and definitions with regard to the cryptocurrency and blockchain industries.
