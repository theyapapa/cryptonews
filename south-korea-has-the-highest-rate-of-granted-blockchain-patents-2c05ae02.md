South Korea has the highest blockchain patent grant rate, according to London-based law firm Withers & Rogers.

Meanwhile, Japan comes at a distant second, Intellectual property business media platform IAM reports on July 23.

## Getting a blockchain patent in China is hard

Per the report, South Korea has the highest patent grant rate (54%), followed by Japan (17%), and the United States (16%), with China significantly lagging behind.

The outlet suggests that a reason for this substantial disparity between China and the rest of the world is that a sizable portion of those patents outside China follow a procedure where the application is not published before the patent is granted.

In China, on the other hand, patent applications must be published before a substantive examination, which may be the reason why less than 2% of the Chinese blockchain patents examined have been granted.

Furthermore, the figures also show that China and the United States account for 62% and 22% of blockchain innovation, being jointly responsible for the vast majority of development in the industry (82%).

At the time data circulating on intellectual property news outlets, showed that the number of global blockchain patent filings significantly outstrips the patent filings for other technologies.
