Prague-based crypto wallet manufacturer Trezor has responded to а report about hardware vulnerabilities from its competitor Ledger on Tuesday, March 12.

Trezor claims that none of the weaknesses revealed by Ledger in a detailed report on March 10, are critical for hardware wallets.

As per Trezor, none of them can be exploited remotely, as the attacks described require “physical access to the device, specialized equipment, time, and technical expertise.”

Furthermore, Trezor noted that a “$5 wrench attack” — a targeted theft when the user is forced by intruders to disclose his password — cannot be prevented by a hardware barrier set by the manufacturer.

Nonetheless, in the case of accidental thefts, the probability of cracking a Trezor wallet is relatively small, as the criminals will not be able to find the necessary equipment, the company states.

Of the five vulnerabilities in Trezor One and Trezor T disclosed by Ledger, Trezor said that four of them are patched, non-exploitable or require a pin.
