UTRUST says these partnerships mean that from the first day of operation, thousands of merchants will be able to accept cryptocurrencies in a simplified way, while receiving fiat currencies in their bank accounts.

The company believes, the large amount of merchants will offset the lower figures of cryptocurrency use, gaining UTRUST a substantial foot-hold in the on coming crypto economy.

While several companies like BitPay or Coinbase have risen to the challenge of bridging the gap between crypto and traditional vendors, UTRUST differentiates itself as "the first cryptocurrency payment solution to offer instant transactions, buyer protection, and crypto-to-cash settlements."

UTRUST hopes to become the "PayPal of Crypto" by offering protection for both buyers and sellers.

UTRUST recently announced that the former eBay head of European partnerships and Head of Marketplaces and Large Enterprise Partnerships for PayPal in the U.K, Sanja Kon, has joined the company.

The company says, this, combined with 1 percent merchant fees, promises to trigger a feedback cycle of more customers bringing more merchants into cryptocurrency, and so on ad infinitum.

It is the belief of the company that its dispute resolution system, one percent merchant fees, and simple interface will be enough to bring merchants and customers into the global crypto ecosystem.
