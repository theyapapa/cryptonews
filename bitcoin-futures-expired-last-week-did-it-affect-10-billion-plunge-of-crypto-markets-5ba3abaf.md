# Bitcoin Futures Expired Last Week, Did It Affect $10 Billion Plunge of Crypto Markets? ...

## Bitcoin is still en route to $2,000

The crypto market is set to experience the longest correction in its 10-year history, and based on the intensity of the sell-off of major crypto assets in the past several months, the bear market will likely extend across the first two quarters of 2019.

The futures market has often been used as a short-term price indicator of Bitcoin, as it was said that the expiration of futures could incentivize investors to attempt to manipulate the market.

Bakkt, which is set to launch later this quarter, will become the first physically settled Bitcoin futures market in the U.S.

Jake Chervinsky, a government enforcement defence and securities litigation attorney at Kobre & Kim, explained that physically settled contracts like Bakkt could have an actual impact on the price of the asset in the future.

Historically, Les said that the CME Bitcoin market, which was highly anticipated by investors in the cryptocurrency sector, did not sway the price of the asset in a major way.

In the long run, if Bakkt sees a rapid increase in volume and, as a result, other large futures market operators — such as ErisX, CME, CBOE and potentially even the Nasdaq — experience exponential growth, the correlation between futures and the Bitcoin price on exchanges could increase.

## Potential impact of major Bitcoin investment vehicle launches in 2019

Speaking to Cointelegraph, Les said that if Fidelity Bitcoin custody launches in March, it will likely not have an immediate impact on price, and the same could be said for Bakkt and Nasdaq.

If we break below $3000 for Bitcoin, “crypto winter” will become “crypto nuclear winter”... https://t.co/sS83cl6Em1

“All of this \[...\] (CME, Bakkt, Fidelity) is positive news for what is clearly an emerging asset.
