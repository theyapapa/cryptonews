###### 2019-01-31 08:01

Japanese online broker Monex Group — owner of previously hacked cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck — released its financial report on Q3 for the 2019 fiscal year on Jan. 31.

They indicate that Monex’s crypto asset segment — comprised of Coincheck, which was acquired by Monex in April 2018 — reported an overall loss of 300 million yen (~$2.76 million ).

As previously reported, Coincheck had suffered an industry record-breaking hack in January, 2018, when about $534 million worth of NEM (XEM) was stolen from its wallets.

Monex’s results also reveal that as of December, 2018, 1.73 million downloads of the Coincheck app were recorded, of which 900,000 proceeded to become users with a confirmed identity.

Aside from resuming trading on the platform in fall, Monex has this month secured an official operating license for Coincheck from Japanese regulators, having worked last year to rehaul the platform’s security and management systems, as well as to reimburse victims of the hack.

The fraud reportedly involves potential victims being invited to call a form of automated trading system purportedly linked to Monex — something the firm has stressed does not exist.
