The vast majority of British people - 93 percent - have heard of Bitcoin (BTC), but only 4 percent claim to have bought it, according to a recent poll by UK market research company YouGov published Nov. 7.

Only 4 percent of those surveyed claimed they understand Bitcoin “very well,” while 23 percent state they know it “fairly well,” with men almost three times as likely as women to say so (33 percent against 12 percent).

Younger Brits prevail among those who claimed to understand Bitcoin, the report states.

One in eleven (9 percent) of British 18 to 24 year olds have purchased Bitcoin, in comparison to one in a hundred (1 percent) for people over 55.

However, overall, only 4 percent of respondents have purchased Bitcoin, with the gender break down significantly more male – 6 percent of men, compared to 1 percent of women surveyed.

Additionally, a significant number of young people, 36 percent of those surveyed in the 18 to 24 year old range, claim they personally know someone who has bought Bitcoin before.

Out of 1,000 Germans between the ages of 18 and 39 polled, 55 percent claimed they have heard of cryptocurrencies before.
