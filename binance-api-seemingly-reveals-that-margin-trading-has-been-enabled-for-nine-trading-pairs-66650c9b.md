Changes made to the public Application Programming Interface (API) of major cryptocurrency exchange Binance seemingly reveal that the company has enabled margin trading for nine trading pairs.

The self-explanatory variable names seemingly suggest that Binance is in the midst of implementing margin trading capability.

A Reddit user pointed out on May 1 that the isMarginTradingAllowed flag — which was previously disabled for all the pairs — is now enabled for nine trading pairs.

Binance first promised in the feature rollout section of its white paper that margin trading would be implemented after spot trading and before futures on its exchange.

As one Reddit user points out in a comment to the post, what is new now is the actual change in the API.

As Cointelegraph reported in March, Japanese financial regulators have reportedly introduced new regulations for cryptocurrency margin trading.

Also in February, major Malta-based cryptocurrency exchange OKEx added four new margin trading pairs to its platform with up to 100x leverage.
