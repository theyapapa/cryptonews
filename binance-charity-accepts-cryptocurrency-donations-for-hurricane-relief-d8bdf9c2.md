Binance Charity, the philanthropic wing of major cryptocurrency exchange Binance, has begun a campaign to help support victims of Hurricane Dorian.

On Sept. 5, Binance Charity started accepting cryptocurrency donations for a campaign that will help provide food and aid for hurricane victims through local organizations in affected areas.

On the campaign website, Binance states that donations in Bitcoin (BTC), Binance Coin (BNB) and XRP will be distributed to the Hurricane Relief Project.

According to Binance Charity, the donations and eventual disbursements will be recorded on a blockchain, making the process more transparent.

In addition to asking the blockchain and crypto communities for donations, Binance Charity has also asked for recommendations on how to make disbursing aid faster and more effective.

Binance Charity has previously supported initiatives for womenâ€™s health and education.

Last month, independent public charity Fidelity Charitable announced that it received $100 million in cryptocurrency donations since it began accepting them in 2015.
