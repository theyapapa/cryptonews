Italian football club AS Roma will join blockchain-based voting platform Socios through a partnership with sports and entertainment blockchain firm Chiliz.

In an official announcement published on July 19, Chiliz revealed that AS Roma is joining Socios, a sports platform powered by Chiliz, in order to launch an AS Roma fan token.

The post further explains that “the more fans vote and interact with the club through the app, the more rewards they can earn, competing for once-in-a-lifetime experiences, and gaining access to exclusive merchandise, games and leaderboards.”

Alexandre Dreyfus, CEO & Founder of Socios, commented on the partnership:

“This partnership gives us the opportunity to educate a huge audience of mainstream consumers to the benefits of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, across Europe as well as Asia and Latin America.

In mid-May, Chiliz announced a strategic partnership with Binance Chain, the mainnet of major cryptocurrency exchange Binance.

At the time, Dreyfus underscored that the new integration with the Binance Chain mainnet would increase Socios’ access to the liquidity pool of the worldwide Binance community.

Recently, major Portuguese sports club SL Benfica revealed it now accepts cryptocurrency for merchandise and tickets.
