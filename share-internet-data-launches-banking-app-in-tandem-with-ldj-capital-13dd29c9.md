Internet crowdsourcing company Share Internet Data Ltd (SID) has partnered with private equity firm LDJ Capital to launch a blockchain-based digital banking solution.

The new digital banking app is called LDJ Digital, according to a press release on July 16.

Moreover, the professed goal of LDJ Digital is to provide banking services to the unbanked, as per the report.

LDJ Digital will reportedly be a part of the existing SID platform and is based on its core technologies and principles.

The SID and blockchain technology underpinning LDJ Digital will purportedly make banking accessible and affordable for the unbanked, the press release says.

SID reportedly allows users to provide Internet to other users via its mobile app, somewhat like a mobile hotspot.

LDJ Digital CEO Jose Merino commented that financial inclusion is a natural upshot of a free Internet ecosystem:

"Free access to the internet opens the floodgates of access to a host of other global resources.
