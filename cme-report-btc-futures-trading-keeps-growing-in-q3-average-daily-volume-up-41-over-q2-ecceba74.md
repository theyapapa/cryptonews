Bitcoin (BTC) futures trading at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) has continued to grow in Q3, the U.S.-based exchange reported in a tweet Wednesday, Oct. 17.

The CME has revealed that the average daily trading volume (ADV) of Bitcoin futures has increased by 41 percent in Q3 over Q2, while open interest (OI) — or the number of open contracts on Bitcoin futures — has risen by 19 percent in the third quarter.

On July 20, the CME reported that Bitcoin futures trading in Q2 had seen a large increase, with ADV and OI up 93 and 58 percent over Q1, respectively.

The company had also launched Bitcoin futures trading on Dec. 17, 2017, shortly after the launch of BTC futures by the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) on Dec. 10.

In his prediction, Neuner compared ETFs with Bitcoin futures, claiming that the expectation of BTC futures contracts allegedly made the major cryptocurrency rally last year from “$6,691 (Nov. 11) to $20,000 (Dec .17).”

Recently, Bloomberg reported that the CME was not planning to introduce futures on any cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin in the near future.

Terry Duffy, chief executive officer of CME, had reportedly revealed that the company should first work on the approach to Bitcoin futures, since it “might have been the most controversial launch of a product.”
