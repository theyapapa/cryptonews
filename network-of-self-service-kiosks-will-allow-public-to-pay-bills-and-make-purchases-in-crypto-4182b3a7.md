A blockchain-based company has unveiled plans to roll out a global network of self-service kiosks — enabling millions of unbanked people around the world to pay bills, make purchases and access other financial services.

KIBIS says a plethora of services are available through its kiosks.

“High efficiency” mining equipment is also going to be embedded within each KIBIS kiosk, with each machine enjoying access to a low-cost source of electricity.

Self-service kiosks can already be found dotted around the world, including in the United Arab Emirates, Ukraine, Russia, the United Kingdom, Azerbaijan and other countries throughout Eastern Europe.

## Key kiosk developments

The public presale for KIBIS is beginning on Dec. 10, 2018, and this will be followed by a full Initial Coin Offering.

Looking ahead to 2019, KIBIS plans to begin ordering the manufacture of kiosks with built-in mining equipment that will be destined for the United Arab Emirates, as well as signing agreements with the locations where the kiosks will be based.

Toward the end of next year, KIBIS hopes to begin deploying kiosks in Oman — and start development of the e-wallets its consumers will use, which will boast more than 2,000 services.
