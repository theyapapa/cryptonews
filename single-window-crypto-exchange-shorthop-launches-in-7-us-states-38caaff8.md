###### 2019-08-27 02:08

Cryptocurrency exchange and brokerage ShortHop is now operating in seven additional U.S. states allowing its users to work with multiple trading platforms’ order books via a single window.

## One exchange to trade them all

Per the report, despite the fact that ShortHop’s parent company — technology provider Velocity Markets — was already registered as a money services business with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, the exchange had to apply for additional money transmitter licenses in each state where it intends to operate.

Notably, ShortHop is a “spot fill market” that allows its customers to trade digital assets across various order books — including its own — in one place.

\[...\] ShortHop is a spot market first, but we’re aggregating liquidity across the ecosystem.”

According to Kelfer, in addition to its own exchange, ShortHop “is currently plugged into a total of eight exchanges and OTC desks.”

## Retail now, institutions later

Presently, ShortHop’s users can buy and trade Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Stellar Lumens (XLM) and Ripple XRP.

He also noted that ShortHop plans to offer its plug-in service to various institutions in the future, adding:

“We’d rather do this than nickel-and-dime retail users who should have access to the same quality of infrastructure that large players do.
