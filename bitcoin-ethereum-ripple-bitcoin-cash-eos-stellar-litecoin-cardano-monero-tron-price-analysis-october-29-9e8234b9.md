# Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, EOS, Stellar, Litecoin, Cardano, Monero, TRON: Price Analysis, October 29 ...

Though the exchange was small, repeated news of hacks are a major deterrent to the entry of institutional investors into the crypto industry.

Therefore, Fidelityâ€™s entry into the custody service business is a big positive, as it will assure institutional investors have the same level of security that they are used to with traditional assets.

## BCH/USD

After trading close to the support line for the past few days, Bitcoin Cash broke down of the symmetrical triangle today.

A break down of $0.184 will complete the descending triangle pattern that can result in a fall to the next support at $0.08.

However, if the bears succeed in breaking and closing (UTC time frame) below this level, it will complete a bearish descending triangle pattern that can result in a fall to $40, and below that to $29.

The LTC/USD pair will signal strength if it rebounds from the support and breaks out of the triangle at $60.

If the bears succeed in closing (UTC time frame) below the support line of the triangle, it will increase the probability of a fall to the bottom of the range at $0.060105.
