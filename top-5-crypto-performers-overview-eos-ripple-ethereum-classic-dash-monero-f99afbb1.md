#  Top 5 Crypto Performers Overview: EOS, Ripple, Ethereum Classic, Dash, Monero ...

###### 2018-10-28 19:10

The crypto markets are stuck in a very tight range for the past few weeks.

The breakout or breakdown of the range is likely to start a new trend that will remain in force for a few days.

The fact that the crypto markets have not been affected by the decline in the stock markets in the past few days is a positive thing.

## EOS/USD

Barring Tether, EOS was the best performer in the past seven days, rising just under a percent.

However, the breakout to new highs above $18.67 turned out to be a bull trap because the prices have plunged about 76 percent since then.

## XRP/USD

Progress on xRapid, real-time settlement platform and xCurrent payment solutions have kept Ripple in the news for the past few days.

## ETC/USD

Ethereum Classic has seen positive developments in the past few weeks.
