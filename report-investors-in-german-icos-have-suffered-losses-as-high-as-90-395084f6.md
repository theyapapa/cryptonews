Investors in German ICOs have lost up to 90 percent of their capital, Cointelegraph auf Deutsch reports Monday, October 1.

German business magazine WirtschaftsWoche compared the token issue prices of Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) carried out by German startups with the prices of early September 2018.

The report found that, with up to 90 percent loss in value, the German startup coins lost even more value than lead coins like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), which have also fallen sharply following record highs at the end of 2017.

Many other German ICOs were carried out by legally independent companies abroad.

Among the numerous German token publishers, only the financing platform Neufund and the shopping app Wysker managed to keep the value of their tokens stable.

Last summer, IT industry association Bitkom reported that German IT startups continue to prefer a classic Initial Public Offering (IPO) over an ICO for raising capital.

In a survey of 302 IT and internet startups, 22 percent of respondents reported that they planned to go public, while only three percent said they wanted to raise funds with a token offering.
