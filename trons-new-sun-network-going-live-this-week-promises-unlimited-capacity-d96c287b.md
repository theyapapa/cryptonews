Blockchain platform Tron’s founder, Justin Sun, announced that the first version of the Tron (TRX) scalability solution called “Sun Network” will be released on Aug. 10, in a tweet published on Aug. 4.

## 100x scalability for the Tron blockchain

In his tweet, Sun claimed that the first version of the network will allow for 100x scalability and the building of decentralized applications on sidechains.

According to the Sun Network’s official website — to which Sun’s tweet linked — the new sidechain system will feature free transactions, 100 times lower fees, decentralized application (DApp) support and faster transaction confirmation.

Furthermore, the Sun Network will also allegedly allow for longer smart contract execution times, and interchain withdrawals and deposits.

According to another section of the aforementioned website:

“Sun Network is also designed to provide unlimited capacity for TRON main network to support the growing number of transactions.”

As Cointelegraph reported at the end of July, in its latest rankings, the Chinese CCID Research Institute put Bitcoin (BTC) in eleventh place on a list of 37 digital currencies in terms of technology, while placing Tron third.

In April, blockchain development company Lightning Labs announced that it released the first alpha version of its version of the Lightning Network scalability solution for the main Bitcoin (BTC) network.
