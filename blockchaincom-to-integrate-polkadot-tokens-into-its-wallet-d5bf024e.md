Luxembourg-based crypto data supplier and crypto wallet Blockchain.com has partnered with blockchain interoperability protocol Polkadot.

## Driving decentralization 

On Aug. 20, Blockchain.com announced it will integrate its Blockchain Wallet with the Polkadot Network in order to drive the adoption and decentralization of Polkadot tokens (DOTs).

Once the integration is complete, users of Blockchain.com will be able to store, send and receive DOTs, as well as to vote on proposed amendments to the network protocol and council members.

Peter Smith, co-founder and CEO of Blockchain.com, noted in the announcement that Polkadot is “exactly the type of purpose-driven network” that is supported by the company.

He stated that the team behind Polkadot shares Blockchain.com’s vision for more decentralization and increased user control.

The project is being developed by the founders of Parity Technologies, Polkadot founder and Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood and Ethereuem’s first security chief Jutta Steiner.

Following the distribution of tokens, Polkadot introduced its experimental version of the protocol dubbed Kusama.
