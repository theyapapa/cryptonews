Bitcoin (BTC) really does function as a safe haven asset in 2019, another source has told mainstream media as the United States-China trade war rages.

## Bitcoin increasingly important amid economic uncertainty

Speaking to Forbes in an interview on Aug. 8, Chris Reinertsen, chief marketing officer of blockchain consultancy Rhythm Technologies, said investors were pouring into Bitcoin in addition to traditional safe haven assets.

He added:

“Throughout the last few years, we have been seeing the trend of Bitcoin increasingly becoming fundamentally correlated to more macro moves as increased economic uncertainty in the world increases.”

## Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation

As Cointelegraph reported, Reinertsen is far from alone in his hypothesis.

The latest dispute involving China, which saw the U.S. government brand Beijing a currency manipulator, appeared to fuel a fresh upturn in the Bitcoin price this week.

Reinertsen likewise pointed to China’s deliberate devaluation of the yuan to an 11-year low against the dollar as a factor driving money into Bitcoin.

His view on China more broadly was shared by Circle CEO, Jeremy Allaire, who similarly mentioned macroeconomic motivation while explaining Bitcoin’s sudden bull market this week.
