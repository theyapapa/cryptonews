— Banbreach (@Banbreach) October 5, 2018While CoinHive is not an inherently malicious code — charities have employed it and analogues like it — it has become popular among hackers for illicitly mining cryptocurrency on web surfers’ computers, or cryptojacking.

Related research reportedly suggests that the total output of all machines “infected” with CoinHive generate over $250,000 in XMR every month.

Per the report, over 13,500 home routers in India were infected by cryptojacking malware — a figure that was only outflanked globally by Brazil.
