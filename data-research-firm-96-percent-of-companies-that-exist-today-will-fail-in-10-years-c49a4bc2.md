Singapore-based data science firm DATAVLT says that 99 percent of corporate data is wasted and never used to draw knowledge from it.

Worldwide, big business is coming to realize the importance of data analytics.

According to a 2017 Gartner study, “Out of 13 marketing capabilities, chief marketing officers \[polled by Gartner\] allocate 9.2 percent of their total marketing expense budget on marketing analytics — the most of any capability.”

In absolute numbers, spending 9.2 percent of a marketing budget of, say, $10 million is $920,000, and not an uncommon price tag for data analytics projects.

Amazon spends $7.2 billion on marketing worldwide, and data analytics is Amazon’s core competency.

“If you do not have five to six figure budget, you will not get anything of value out of the data”, said DATAVLT’s co-founder Michelle Yeo to Cointelegraph.

The company targets its affordable Software as a Service (SaaS) data analytics product specifically to smaller and medium business, seeing the most potential demand in the Asia-Pacific region.
