# ‘Hope Coin’: The Story of Malaysia’s Crypto Political Fundraising Platform ...

The ongoing controversy surrounding Malaysia’s proposed political cryptocurrency, Harapan Coin, is far from letting up.

The manifesto — found on the coin’s website — presented the group behind the project as “patriotic and concerned Malaysian citizens, within and outside of Malaysia.”

The identities of the people working on Harapan Coin have been concealed all along, citing “the Draconian laws of limiting and non-respecting \[sic\] individual rights to freedom of expression of the current BN government,” the website contains only their first names, blurred pictures and locations in countries outside Malaysia.

May 9, 2018, marked the first regime change in Malaysian history: Following the general election, the Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition managed to secure 121 out of 222 seats in the Dewan Rakyat — the lower house of the nation’s parliament — keeping Barisan Nasional down to just 79 seats.

Now that the anti-BN coalition has prevailed, it looks like Samad is working to repurpose the Harapan Coin infrastructure to serve the fundraising needs of his coalition in the new political environment, where they are the incumbent political power rather than the opposition aspiring to topple a longstanding regime.

On Nov. 13, he announced that paperwork for Harapan Coin’s presentation before Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) and Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad.

While it is hardly unexpected that recently deposed Prime Minister Najib Razak has spoken out against Harapan Coin, the sources of criticism are not confined to Samad’s political opponents.
