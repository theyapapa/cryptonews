# Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum, Stellar, EOS, Litecoin, Cardano, Monero, TRON, DASH: Price Analysis, Nov. 16 ...

###### 2018-11-16 15:11

On the other hand, if the bears defend the $5,900â€“ $6,075 levels and the virtual currency turns down from there, it will indicate selling by the long positions stuck at higher levels and short initiation by traders who anticipate lower levels in the future.

## EOS/USD

EOS broke below the support of $4.493 on Nov. 15, but buying at lower levels pushed prices back above it.

## LTC/USD

Litecoin made successive new year-to-date lows on Nov. 14 and 15, which shows that it is one of the weaker cryptocurrencies.

After breaking below the support at $47.246 on Nov. 14, it followed up with a new low the next day, which was close to our first lower target of $40.

## ADA/USD

Cardano broke below the critical support of $0.060105 on Nov.15 but the bears could not sustain below the lows.

## XMR/USD

Monero bounced off the critical support at $81 on Nov. 15, but higher levels are attracting selling by the bears.

The down-sloping moving averages and the RSI close to the oversold level shows that the bears have an upper hand and the path of least resistance is to the downside.
