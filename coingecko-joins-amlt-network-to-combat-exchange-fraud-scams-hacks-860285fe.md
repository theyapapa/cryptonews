Crypto market aggregator CoinGecko has joined the network of blockchain analytics and anti-money laundering (AML) company Coinfirm.

This partnership will reportedly allow CoinGecko to improve its exchange Trust Score algorithm, as well as provide users with a means to report scams and hacks.

According to documentation from Coinfirm, the company runs the AMLT network that allows members to report cryptocurrency addresses tied to hacks, ransomware, scams and fraud.

CoinGecko apparently intends to make use of the AMLT Token Network alongside Coinfirm’s Analytics and AML Platform in bolstering its ranking system.

CoinGecko users will also reportedly have the option to report crypto addresses themselves, in a system like the foregoing one provided for AMLT network members.

Individual users will be able to submit information on scams and hacks tied to crypto addresses, via a widget, and will likewise be rewarded in AMLT tokens.

CoinGecko co-founder Bobby Ong commented:

“We believe that transparency is key in this industry and hope that by using the AMLT Network’s and Coinfirm’s data, our users will be better able to make judgements on exchanges while also helping provide data to bring even more transparency and security.
