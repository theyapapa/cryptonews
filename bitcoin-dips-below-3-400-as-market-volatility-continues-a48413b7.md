While crypto markets have continued seeing a decline since Sunday, Dec. 9, the former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has recently argued that Bitcoin should be considered a “lottery ticket.”

Following multiple reports about the collapse of the crypto mining sector caused by the recent market crash, Cointelegraph has reported today that to date, only two miners that use Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) chips and are geared to mine coins that are based on cryptographic hash function “SHA-256” –– such as Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash –– are still profitable for mining.
