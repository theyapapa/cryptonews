A global threat report has concluded that the three most common malware variants detected in April were crypto miners, according to a news release on May 14.

Check Point Research said Cryptoloot, malware that uses the victim’s computing power to mine for crypto without their knowledge, was last month’s biggest threat.

Despite their prevalence, the company’s researchers believe that criminals are shifting their focus away from crypto mining.

In addition, the collapse in crypto prices at the start of the year meant other strategies were more lucrative.

Maya Horowitz, the company’s threat intelligence and research director, said:

“As these malware constantly morph, it is crucial to have a robust line of defense against them with advanced threat prevention.”

Last month, American software company Symantec detected a spike in a new crypto mining malware, Beapy, that targets enterprises.

Also in April, two Romanian cybercriminals were convicted in the United States of spreading malware to steal credit card details and illicitly mine crypto.
