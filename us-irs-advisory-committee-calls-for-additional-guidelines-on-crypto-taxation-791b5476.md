# US: IRS Advisory Committee Calls for Additional Guidelines on Crypto Taxation ...

An advisory committee of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) wants the agency to provide additional guidelines for the taxation of crypto transactions, according to a 2018 general report published Oct. 24.

Although in 2014 the IRS had already issued commentary specifically on digital currencies, recommending they be treated as a property, the Information Reporting Program Advisory Committee (IRPAC) believes that crypto-specific taxation should be reviewed due to the growing public interest in cryptocurrencies.

The crypto industry itself and those who work in taxes often still are uncertain when it comes to the “tax consequences” of cryptocurrency transactions, the report goes on.

The advisors further list the main questions surrounding the current taxation scheme:

“Many industry and tax practitioners still question other tax consequences of cryptocurrency transactions.

Furthermore, in the discussion section of the report, the IRPAC cites Fundstrat Global Advisors research published back in April 2018, which estimated that the potential tax liabilities of cryptocurrencies could form up to $25 billion.

Based on the Fundstrat report, the IRPAC came to a conclusion that at least 50 percent of tax liabilities from cryptocurrency transactions in the U.S. could have gone unreported.

In September of this year, a group of U.S. lawmakers urged the IRS to clarify the taxation rules for cryptocurrency, stating, similarly to the IRPAC, that the preliminary guidance issued four years ago was outdated, as the crypto industry had significantly changed since then.
