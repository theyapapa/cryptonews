After two arrests in one week, John McAfee says he wants to run for President of the United States and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom simultaneously.

## McAfee: ‘I am one of the few’

On July 26, the same day when McAfee revealed his “record” second arrest in a week, the U.S. presidential candidate expressed his intention to run for UK Prime Minister too, stressing that he is one of the few people still alive who could qualify.

The well-known Bitcoin (BTC) bull and cybersecurity pioneer tweeted:

“Can a person run for, and be, President of the United States and Prime Minister of Great Britain simultaneously?

McAfee elaborated that in order to qualify for the position, one should meet two requirements — be a U.S. citizen born on U.S. soil and a British citizen born in England.

As per McAfee, he meets both requirements as he was not just born in England, but also he was born on an American Army base in England.

## Bitcoin donations accepted

Earlier today, McAfee reported that he saw his second jail cell this week just a day after his release in the Dominican Republic, where he was arrested for four days.

Reportedly wanted by the U.S., McAfee plans to accept Bitcoin donations for his presidential campaign, which he runs from a boat on which he arrived in the Domican Republic.
