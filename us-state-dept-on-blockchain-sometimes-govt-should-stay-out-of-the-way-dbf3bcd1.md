The event, organized by blockchain advocacy group the Chamber of Digital Commerce (CDC), featured various influential speakers from U.S. politics.

Speaking about the State Department’s perspective on blockchain and what the agency looks to other nations for, Singh stated:

Speaking at the same event, Christopher Giancarlo, chairman of U.S. regulator the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), even considered blockchain as a would-be mitigating factor in the 2008 economic crash.

“What a difference it would have made a decade ago if blockchain technology had been the informational foundation of Wall Street’s derivatives exposures,” Cointelegraph reported him as saying on Thursday.
