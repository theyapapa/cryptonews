# Post-Hearing: Ranking Senate Committee Members Discuss Regulations ...

###### 2019-07-16 14:07

United States Senators Mike Crapo and Sherrod Brown, respectively the Senate Banking Committee chair and ranking member, shared their views on crypto regulations.

Both appear to want comprehensive policy for big tech companies.

Senator Crapo stressed the importance of building an overarching regulatory framework for data protection — not just for Facebook, but for all Internet companies looking to launch their own cryptocurrencies, á la the Financial Stability Oversight Council for banks.

Senator Brown appeared to agree with Crapo, saying “it will be hard to do something comprehensive, but I hope we can.”

Senator Brown also discussed how the public no longer trusts big tech companies:

"Clearly, Americans don't trust Wall Street.

Because they've seen the betrayal and the undermining of our democratic values in Facebook and in other tech companies."

Brown also discussed a bill under discussion with the House Financial Services Committee, “Keep Big Tech Out Of Finance Act,” which would make it illegal for big tech companies in the U.S. to run a digital asset service such as crypto:

“A large platform utility may not establish, maintain, or operate a digital asset that is intended to be widely used as medium of exchange, unit of account, store of value, or any other similar function, as defined by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.”
