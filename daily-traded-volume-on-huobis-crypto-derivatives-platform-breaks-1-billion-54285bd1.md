Daily traded volume of cryptocurrency contracts on the Huobi Derivatives Market (DM) has broken past $1 billion, according to a press release shared with Cointelegraph on Dec. 27.

Huobi Global — which operates the world’s third-largest largest crypto spot market trading platform — launched Huobi DM last month.

Having reportedly broken past $1 billion in daily trades on Dec. 25, Huobi DM is today expanding its crypto contracts offerings to include altcoin EOS.

Huobi claims its crypto contracts help market participants control risk and uncertainty via price limit mechanisms and supervision tools that allow traders to monitor contract and index prices and positions in real time.

According to the company, Dec. 25 saw strong engagement on both the newly-launched DM platform and Huobi’s flagship crypto exchange; their combined daily traded volume was purportedly $2 billion.

Huobi DM’s launch comes at a moment when trading volumes across various exchanges are reported to have fallen dramatically.

A recent study from weekly crypto outlet Diar claimed that data sampled from across eight leading crypto exchanges — Binance, OKex, Huobi, Bitfinex, Kraken, Poloniex, Bittrex and HitBTC — showed that 60 percent of the still-listed cryptocurrencies are now trading at lower volumes than in January.
