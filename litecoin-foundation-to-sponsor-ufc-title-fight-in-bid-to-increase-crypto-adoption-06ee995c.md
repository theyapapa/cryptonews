The Litecoin Foundation will sponsor an event of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) mixed martial arts organization, according to an announcement published Dec. 26.

The Litecoin Foundation stated that the sponsorship is part of its effort to expand the adoption of digital currencies, saying:

“With brands and institutions continuing to push into cryptocurrency and blockchain, this is yet another signal of this technology moving closer towards the mainstream.”

Raising funds through sponsorship purportedly attracts new sponsors to the market, with cryptocurrency-related support gradually expanding to date.

In December, Brazilian premier league soccer club Atletico Mineiro launched a fan token dubbed “GaloCoin” based on Footcoin — a platform for making utility tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.

Atletico’s token will allow fans to purchase game tickets, official apparel, and participate in discount programs.

In September, French soccer club Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) partnered with blockchain platform Socios.com to launch a token ecosystem.

The token will allow the club to launch a Fan Token Offering (FTO) that gives fans access to branded Saint German club tokens.
