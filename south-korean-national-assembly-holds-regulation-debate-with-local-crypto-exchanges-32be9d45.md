ZDNet reports that Lee Seok-wu, CEO of Dunamu — a subsidiary of Kakao that operates Upbit — led a discussion that was attended by FSC members and the president of Gopax, among others.

The debate in the National Assembly was preceded by the FSC’s decision to allow banks to service crypto exchanges, as soon as they have adequate AML safeguards and apply KYC checks.

According to a recent report prepared by CryptoCompare, the crypto industry in South Korea is consistently growing.

In November Korean crypto exchanges overtook Maltese competitors by average daily trade volume.
