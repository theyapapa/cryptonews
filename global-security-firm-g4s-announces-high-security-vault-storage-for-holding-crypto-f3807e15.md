U.K.-based multinational security services company G4S has developed a new service for protecting cryptocurrency assets, the firm announced in an official press release Thursday, Oct. 18.

G4S, formerly Group 4 Securicor, has released an “innovative security solution” for holding crypto assets in a form of high-security offline storage protecting customers from hacks.

According to the senior risk analyst at G4S Consulting Dominic Maciver, the new crypto assets security solution is based on a foundation of “vault storage” that is inaccessible for cyber criminals and hackers, as well as “armed robbers alike.”

The expert explained that the new security solution not only puts crypto assets in a cold storage, but also distributes them into independent components placed securely in the system’s security vaults:

"We not only take the assets offline, but break them up into fragments that are independently without value and store them securely in our high security vaults, out of reach of cyber criminals and armed robbers alike.”

The press release stresses the nascent character of cryptocurrency assets, which stand in a great contrast with the conventional fiat money system.

In June 2018, cybersecurity company Carbon Black estimated that criminals have managed to steal around $1.1 billion worth of cryptocurrencies in the first half of 2018, with 12,000 marketplaces and 34,000 offerings associated with cryptocurrency theft that hackers can take advantage of.

In mid-September, Cointelegraph reported on the hack of Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Zaif, which lost $59 million worth of cryptocurrencies as a result of a security breach.
