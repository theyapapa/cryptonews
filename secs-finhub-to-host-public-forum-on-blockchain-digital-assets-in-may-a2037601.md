United States regulator the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has announced that it is hosting a public forum on distributed ledger technology (DLT) and digital assets this May.

The commission’s Strategic Hub for Innovation and Financial Technology (Finhub) has organized the event — dubbed the Fintech Forum — which will take place on May 31, 2019.

The press release reports that the forum will include industry experts as panelists and is “designed to foster greater communication and understanding around issues involving DLT and digital assets.”

According to the announcement, topics to be covered during the forum include initial coin offerings, cryptocurrency platforms, “DLT innovations, and how these technologies impact investors and the markets.”

The agency reports that the forum is the second in the Fintech Forum series, the first taking place in November 2016.

As previously reported, Finhub was created in fall 2018 with the aim of facilitating the agency’s engagement in fintech-related fields, including DLT and digital assets.

This week, the SEC also announced that Finhub will host a series of local peer-to-peer meetups across the country with the aim of engaging more actively with the crypto and wider fintech community.
