London-based banking alternative Monolith announced its partnership with decentralized finance companies Digix and MakerDAO, Aug. 15.

As part of its drive for digital payment adoption in e-commerce, DGX, DGD and DAI tokens will now be loadable onto the Monolith Visa debit card.

## A critical bridge between the worlds of decentralized finance and retail

Effective immediately, users who sign up for a Monolith Visa debit card will be able to load it up with MakerDAO and Digix’s digital currencies through the Monolith mobile app.

CEO of MakerDAO, Rune Christensen commented:

“Monolith’s solution provides a powerful way for token holders to extend the usefulness of their crypto-holdings.

Back then Monolith announced a partnership with Digix on the launch of the TokenCard Visa debit card.

However, that has now been re-labeled an extended beta test and the card has changed names to the Monolith Visa debit card.

Monolith CEO, Mel Gelderman commented:

“We’re thrilled to have had a fantastic response from our beta users and are now ramping up for growth.
