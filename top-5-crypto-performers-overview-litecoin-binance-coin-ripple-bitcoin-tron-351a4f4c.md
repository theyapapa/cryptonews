# Top 5 Crypto Performers Overview: Litecoin, Binance Coin, Ripple, Bitcoin, Tron ...

###### 2019-02-03 14:02

Although Bitcoin (BTC) has managed to maintain its dominance throughout the bear market, we are seeing some major cryptocurrencies outperform it.

Every bull market has its leaders, and we want to identify the cryptocurrencies that can lead the next move upward.

## BNB/USD

Crypto exchange Binance has entered into a partnership with payment processing company Simplex to offer its customers the ability to buy cryptocurrencies with credit cards.

## BTC/USD

The current bear market in Bitcoin (BTC) has become the longest in its short trading history, overtaking the 2013-2015 bear phase.

Just days after withdrawing its Bitcoin ETF application, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), along with investment firm VanEck and financial services company SolidX, has resubmitted the application to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)

The BTC/USD pair has been trading in small intraweek ranges for the past three weeks.

The TRX/USD pair triggered our buy recommendation when it closed (UTC time frame) above the top of the range last week.

If the bulls push the price back above the range and scale the previous weekâ€™s high at $0.03128011, we can expect the rally to reach $0.04, and if this level is also crossed, the upward move could continue to $0.05218328.
