# Mike Novogratz: I’m Not Selling Bitcoin at $14K Again — It’s Going Higher ...

Galaxy Digital founder and crypto enthusiast Mike Novogratz has predicted that bitcoin (BTC) still has a long way higher to go following its current “spectacular rally.”

With BTC price circling the $11,000 at press time, Novogratz told Bloomberg TV on July 3 that the coin’s spike toward $14,000 and later downwards correction was to be expected as part of its historic moves.

He predicts that the market will see consolidation around the $10,000- 14,000 mark for some time before current momentum enters its next leg and we go higher.

The crypto merchant bank pioneer said the cryptocurrency’s parabolic price moves have been driven by real reasons — pointing to Facebook’s entry into the space with Libra and the fact that payments giants such as Visa and Mastercard have joined the Libra consortium.

In the longer term, Novogratz argued that bitcoin is carving out its niche as a form of digital gold, and that we can expect it to hit a $40,000 valuation and potentially much higher over time.

Given physical gold’s current market cap of $8.5 trillion, bitcoin still has some way to go before it catches up, he conceded — yet emphasized that the coin has become legitimized as a real, hard asset with a fixed supply and robust technology.

In a short remark on the current state of crypto regulation, Novogratz emphasized that the United States is failing to keep pace with the sector, but that Facebook, Visa and Mastercard’s entries will likely serve as a wake-up call that smarter — if not necessarily more — regulation is needed.
