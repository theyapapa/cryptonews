# Polish Crypto Exchange BitMarket Shuts Down Citing Liquidity Loss ...

###### 2019-07-09 08:07

Polish cryptocurrency exchange BitMarket announced its shutdown on its official website on July 8.

When trying to access the exchange through its website, users are instead greeted with the following text message in both English and Polish:

“Dear Users, We regret to inform you that due to the loss of liquidity, since 08/07/2019, Bitmarket.pl/net was forced to cease its operations.

Reddit user OdoBanks pointed out earlier today that the exchange has shown several red flags in the weeks leading to its shutdown.

Lastly, he also claims that some withdrawal attempts have been halted with the exchange asking the users to comply with additional know-your-client (KYC) measures.

The user also claims:

“Exchange representatives \[...\] claimed that this was the long overdue KYC requirement and that they were only targeting people with expired IDs.

They never addressed users' accusations of hiding the fact that the exchange has been hacked.”

Also in June, Firefox’s zero-day security flaw was used in attacks against major crypto exchange and wallet service Coinbase.
