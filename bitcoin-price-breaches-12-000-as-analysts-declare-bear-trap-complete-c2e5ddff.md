# Bitcoin Price Breaches $12,000 As Analysts Suggest ‘Bear Trap’ Complete ...

Bitcoin’s behavior had surprised most earlier in the week, after a bearish move downwards to just $9,700 suddenly U-turned, mushrooming into fresh growth.

Now, charts are looking increasingly like a repeat of bitcoin’s progress in the second half of 2017, regular trader Filb Filb says.

“Last couple days were a bear trap (in my opinion) and Bitcoin continues to look strong,” fellow trader and investor, Josh Rager, continued.

Bitcoin meanwhile also continues to climb in overall market dominance, currently accounting for just under 63% of the total cryptocurrency market cap — the highest since the 2017 price peak.

The figure spells out ongoing pain for altcoin investors, with major tokens failing once again to match bitcoin’s growth performance.

Most others in the top twenty exhibited similar flat performance or modest moves up or down of up to 2.5%.
