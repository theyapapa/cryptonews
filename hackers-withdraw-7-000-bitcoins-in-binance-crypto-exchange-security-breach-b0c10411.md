Binance, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges by daily trade volume, has experienced a major security breach on May 7, according to a statement shared with Cointelegraph on May 7.

Per Binance, hackers employed a variety of tactics including phishing and viruses to obtain a large number of 2FA codes and API keys in addition to other information.

According to the exchange, there was one affected transaction, wherein hackers were able to withdraw 7,000 bitcoins (BTC) worth $40,705,000 at press time.

In a letter on Binance’s website, CEO Changpeng Zhao states that the bitcoins were withdrawn from its hot wallets only, which contain only 2% of the exchange’s total bitcoin holdings.

Zhao states that Binance’s other wallets are unaffected.

Binance will suspend all deposits and withdrawls while it conducts a security review on its systems, which Zhao estimates will take up to one week.

Binance allocates 10% of its total trading fees to finance SAFU.
