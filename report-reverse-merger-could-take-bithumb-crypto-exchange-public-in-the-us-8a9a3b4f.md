Singapore-based holding firm Blockchain Exchange Alliance, which has a controlling stake in major crypto exchange Bithumb, is looking to list in the United States by acquiring a publicly traded company in the country, CNBC reports on Jan. 22.

According to CNBC, a publicly-traded holding company called Blockchain Industries announced that it had a binding letter of intent with Blockchain Exchange Alliance.

Acquiring a publicly-traded company, or a so-called reverse merger, can be a faster way to take a company public than a traditional Initial Public Offering (IPO).

An unnamed source told CNBC that Blockchain Exchange Alliance had considered filing for a public offering in Singapore, but did not want to wait up to two years to complete an IPO.

The sources added that the combined company will eventually “up-list” from over-the-counter (OTC) markets to the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq.

Novogratz bought a crypto start-up called Coin Capital, then merged through a reverse takeover with Canadian shell company Bradmer Pharmaceuticals.

Cryptocurrency exchange ratings and analytics service CER has accused Bithumb of faking up to 94 percent of its trade volume since the late summer of 2018.
