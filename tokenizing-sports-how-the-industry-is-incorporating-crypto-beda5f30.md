As the world continues to move online, sports teams and organizations are beginning to embrace the use of cryptocurrencies and digital tokens to give fans access to exclusive content and items using these new technologies.

In this article, Cointelegraph takes a look at the biggest sports teams and how they’re adopting digital tokens and cryptocurrency to provide their fans with the latest in e-commerce and user engagement.

The success of betting companies has seen many become major sponsors of sports teams around the world.

2019 has seen more recent endorsements deals between cryptocurrency firms and sports teams.

It scratches the surface of collectibles but provides an interesting use case of how a blockchain platform like Ethereum can be used to provide sports fans with collectibles and other exclusive digital content.

Partnerships with the biggest teams in European football — as well as breaking into the American audience for basketball and American football — cannot be understated, and advertising alone is bound to introduce new users to the world of cryptocurrencies and blockchain.
