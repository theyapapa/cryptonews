IBM has announced upgrades to its Blockchain Platform, according to a report by Ledger Insights on June 18.

The new IBM Blockchain Platform will reportedly be able to run on multiple cloud networks, such as major tech corporation Microsoft’s Azure or Amazon Web Services (AWS).

The multicloud platform will be available via Kubernetes, a container program that will reportedly allow users to scale their blockchain networks as needed.

One of the main upshots of its new multicloud framework is that IBM Blockchain Platform 2.0 that IBM boasts on its website is its interoperability.

According to the website, the multicloud platform lets the blockchain participants provide governance across multiple cloud networks, even those with differing privacy environments.

According to the report, IBM’s platform is a variation on the open source blockchain platform Hyperledger Fabric, which is fundamentally the same but with the addition of ease-of-access tools provided by IBM.

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, IBM recently partnered with Brazilian payments non-profit Câmara Interbancária de Pagamentos to release a blockchain ID platform built on Hyperledger Fabric.
