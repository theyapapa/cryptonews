# Ethereum at a Crossroads: Why $180 ETH Is Now Critical for the Bulls ...

###### 2019-09-05 10:09

Trading Ether (ETH) is rarely easy, particularly when bad news surrounding one of the most popular cryptocurrencies isn’t offering any reprieve for enthusiasts.

## The $160 support level is key

A quick look at the daily chart shows that ETH/USD may very well be setting up a support level for its next move up.

Therefore, one could attribute this level to the beginning of what was a pretty big shift in market structure for Ether.

The question now that all Ether traders and holders would like to know: will the key support level break?

The 4-hour chart tells a compelling picture, where two resistance levels were broken recently (labeled A and B) and ETH/USD started to show a bit of strength.

The larger structure shows a compressed move down into the daily support level, and this is usually indicative of a trend reversal.

Currently, ETH isn’t showing much support until the low $100s and this could offer a good opportunity to short should Ether go below $160.
