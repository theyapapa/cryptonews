A company intends to change the ways of traditional advertising by creating a platform called WeBuy.

The company believes its product can change the way buyers and sellers currently communicate by putting the prospective buyer in the center of the process.

The company says that the potential buyers are able to choose whether or not they want to see an ad on the WeBuy platform.

Users create a profile when they want to purchase something, and the information is then sent to WeBuy sellers.

With no commitment needed to actually buy the product, the buyers get rewarded in WBY tokens just for being contacted by the seller.

Every time a seller pays for advertising on WeBuy, the user who invited this company will get a share of this payment.

## “Revolutionizing the token sale format”

In Q1 2019, the company plans to release a full-scale pilot of the platform itself.
