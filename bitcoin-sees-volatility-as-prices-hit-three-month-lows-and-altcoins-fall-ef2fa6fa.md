The dip to $6,150 marks a fresh test of the stability seen in Bitcoin for the past several weeks, the largest cryptocurrency not testing the barrier since mid August.

Bitcoin’s wobble had a knock-on effect on major altcoins meanwhile, with Ethereum (ETH) dropping around 3.3 percent at press time to just hold on to support at $200.

Elsewhere, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) reversed recent gains on the back of speculation over its hard fork, which is due Thursday, Nov. 15.
