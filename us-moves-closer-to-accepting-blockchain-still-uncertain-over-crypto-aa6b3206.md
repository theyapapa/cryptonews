# US Moves Closer to Accepting Blockchain, Still Uncertain Over Crypto ...

Despite concerns expressed by many United States regulators during the recent House Committee on Financial Services’ hearing on Facebook’s proposed digital currency, Libra, an increasing number of U.S. lawmakers are speaking out in favor of developing a permissive regulatory apparatus to prevent stifling innovation in the cryptocurrency sector.

Several days prior to the hearing, the passing of the Blockchain Promotion Act signposted the government’s intention to develop a prudent legislative framework to oversee possible implementation of blockchain technology in various public sectors.

Odell went on to say regarding this:

“The passing of the Blockchain Promotion Act by the Senate creates an opportunity to promote the technology at a federal level and expose more government organizations to how it can bring more transparency and efficiency to their work.

Matsui expressed her assumption that the Blockchain Promotion Act will lay the groundwork for fostering innovation within the distributed ledger technology sector, stating:

“This bipartisan, bicameral bill will bring a broad group of stakeholders together to develop a common definition of blockchain, and, perhaps even more importantly, recommend opportunities to leverage the technology to promote new innovations.”

## Blockchain Working Group to be established within U.S. Department of Commerce 

Within 90 days of the enactment of the Blockchain Promotion Act, the U.S. Secretary of Commerce, Wilbur Ross, will be required to establish a working group within the Department of Commerce.

The group, called the Blockchain Working Group, will be partially comprised of members representing a “cross-section” of federal agencies that could benefit from the adoption of distributed ledger technology, and representatives from industry stakeholders, academic institutions, nonprofit organizations and consumer advocacy groups engaged in activities relating to blockchain technology.

The report will include a recommendation for a definition of “blockchain technology,” in addition to making recommendations on a study examining the range of potential applications for distributed ledger technology and suggesting possible applications for blockchain technology that will promote efficiency within U.S. federal agencies.
