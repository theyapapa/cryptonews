Henri Arslanian, the Asia fintech and crypto leader of PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Hong Kong, has predicted that many institutional players will enter the crypto industry in 2019.

When asked about his outlook on crypto for the next year, Arslanian said that he thinks “there’s a lot of exciting things that the crypto ecosystem is looking forward to in 2019.”

Arslanian also declared that he expects “many more big banks” to enter the space, some by launching their own solutions, others by partnering with or investing in crypto companies.

PwC is an international network of companies that provide consulting and auditing services.

Their Hong Kong office has accepted Bitcoin (BTC) as payment for its advisory services since late 2017.

As Cointelegraph reported earlier this month, Nasdaq — the world’s second-largest stock exchange — has confirmed its plans to launch Bitcoin futures in the first half of 2019.

However, there have been recently reports this year that several Wall Street giants have postponed their plans to move into crypto amid the falling prices of cryptocurrencies.
