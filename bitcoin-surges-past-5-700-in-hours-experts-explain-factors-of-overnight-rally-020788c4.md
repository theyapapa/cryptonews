## Timing of bitcoin recovery is interesting

The abrupt recovery of the crypto market led by the strong upside price movement of bitcoin was largely unexpected due to the controversy surrounding iFinex, the company that oversees the operations of Tether and Bitfinex.

In an exclusive interview with Cointelegraph, Crypto Rand, a widely recognized cryptocurrency trader and technical analyst, said that the upside movement of bitcoin and the rest of the market may have been simply technical.

— Crypto Rand (@crypto\_rand) April 22, 2019Immediately after Tether and Bitfinex’s general counsel, Stuart Hoegner, disclosed in an affidavit submitted to the Supreme Court of the State of New York, eToro CEO Yoni Assia suggested that the incident could serve as a catalyst for the near-term rally of bitcoin.

Several prominent investors in the crypto space such as Vinny Lingham from Multicoin Capital have said that bitcoin surpassing the $6,200 to $6,400 range would officially signal the beginning of a new bull market.

But, most of the year-to-date gain of bitcoin from $3,150 to $5,700 is likely to have started with a sudden surge in the price of bitcoin from $4,200 to $5,000 in the first week of April, which also was caused by technical factors boosted by a spike in the volume of the CME bitcoin futures market.

In the foreseeable future, while some traders have expressed concerns about the Tether controversy, Greenspan noted that if investors dump Tether on the market, investors will likely end up buying bitcoin, further pushing the demand for the asset up.
