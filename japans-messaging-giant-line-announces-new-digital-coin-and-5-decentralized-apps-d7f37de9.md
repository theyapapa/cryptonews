# Japan’s Messaging Giant LINE Announces New Digital Coin and 5 Decentralized Apps ...

LINE’s overseas crypto token LINK has been distributed through transactions on the firm’s own global digital assets exchange “BITBOX” as of early September, and will also be issued as part of a rewards system for dApp users and other services in the LINE ecosystem.

LINE has therefore launched a separate coin, dubbed “LINK Point,” that is exclusive to residents of Japan.

LINK Point will be issued as an incentive to users of LINE’s new DApps, and cannot be traded on the BITBOX exchange, due to domestic regulatory restrictions.

LINK Point can however be used for DApp services, or it can be traded for “LINE Point” tokens in order to be redeemed for purchases and settlement for LINE’s services, as part of LINE Pay.

A total of 1 billion LINK Point and LINK are to be issued, of which 800 million are to be gradually distributed to users of the LINE token economy, and 200 million to be held by LINE as a reserve.

Both tokens will form part of LINE’s new token economy, which is based on the firm’s in-house blockchain network, LINK Chain.

As previously reported, LINE announced that the genesis block of LINK chain had been generated August 23, describing the mainnet at the time as a “service-oriented” blockchain network that would enable dApps to be directly applied to LINE’s messaging platform.Array
