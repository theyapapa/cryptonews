Domain registrar company EnCirca has announced that it is accepting pre-registration applications for the Ethereum website extension, “.

EnCirca also said that they were the first registrar approved by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) to accept applications for Ethereum domain websites.

According to the press release, EnCirca was motivated to start including blockchain-related extensions in its registrar due to the lack of regulation for these extension names.

Encirca says that some domain names like “.COM” and “.ORG” are regulated, while blockchain domain names are not.

The president of EnCirca, Tom Barrett, also commented on the growing number of blockchain wallets as a motivation for implementing brand security mechanisms for blockchain-related trademarks:

"Billions of internet users will soon have blockchain wallets for sending and receiving cryptocurrencies \[...\] In response, EnCirca has made it easy for brand owners to protect their trademarks on the blockchain."

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, a mysterious individual filed to trademark the name “Samsung Coin” with the Korean Intellectual Property Office.

The individual filed under the name Kim Nam-jin on July 10, while also attempting to trademark ThinQ Wallet — a name that LG Electronics had already applied for on July 2.
