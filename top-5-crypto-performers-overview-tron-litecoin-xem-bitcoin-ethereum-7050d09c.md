However, others believe that the current fall is a buying opportunity and the digital currency can make a new high in the future.

The trend is down as the digital currency has failed to hold key support levels throughout the year.

After such a massive decline, we anticipate the virtual currency to enter into a range and form a base, before starting a new uptrend.

On the other hand, if the bears maintain the price below the range and sink below the Nov. 25 intraday low of $0.06155741, the next support on the downside is at $0.05.

The RSI has reached levels last seen in early 2015, which shows the kind of damage the digital currency has seen this year.

After showing promise through the middle of the year, the ETH/USD pair has turned weak, as it continues to break down at critical support levels.

If the bears turn the digital currency down from one of the above-mentioned resistance levels, and sink it below $100, a fall to $66 is possible.
