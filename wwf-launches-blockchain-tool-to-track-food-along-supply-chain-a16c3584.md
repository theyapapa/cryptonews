# WWF Launches Blockchain Tool to Track Food Along Supply Chain ...

World Wildlife Fund-Australia (WWF-Australia) has announced the launch of a supply chain tool that uses blockchain to allow businesses and consumers to track food items, according to a tweet today, Jan. 17.

The platform, dubbed OpenSC, is the product of a partnership between WWF-Australia and BCG Digital Ventures (BCGDV) — the global corporate venture, investment and incubation arm of United States-based Boston Consulting Group.

According to a post on the WWF site, the system allows both businesses to track products they produce, and consumers to view the origins of said products via a “unique blockchain code at the product’s point of origin.”

The codes are then linked to a blockchain platform to allow consumers to check the origin and life cycle of the specific product.

WWF-Australia CEO Dermot O’Gorman commented in an accompanying press release Jan. 17:

“Through OpenSC, we will have a whole new level of transparency about whether the food we eat is contributing to environmental degradation of habitats and species, as well as social injustice and human rights issues such as slavery.”

This week, computing giant IBM’s own blockchain platform saw two fresh implementations involving cobalt production in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the broader global mining industry.

In November meanwhile, a Swiss food manufacturer became the first to use the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain to track fish products.
