Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin says the Ethereum blockchain is almost full.

In an interview with The Star published Aug. 19, he said the hurdle that faces big organizations interested in the Ethereum ecosystem is the still-thorny matter of the blockchain’s scalability.

## “Scalability is a big bottleneck”

Buterin’s stark comments were made as part of a discussion of what he perceives to be the biggest roadblocks to the widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies.

He conceded that:

“Scalability is a big bottleneck because the Ethereum blockchain is almost full.

There is pressure keeping people from joining \[...\]”

As for how to improve the situation, Buterin said that networks need to evolve away from the idea that every computer is required to verify each and every transaction to a model whereby a computer on average verifies only a small portion of the transactions on the blockchain.

Beyond scalability improvements and other technical advances, Buterin noted that the challenge remains in terms of transforming blockchain technology into something people will actually use.

In July, Buterin had proposed using the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) blockchain as a temporary scalability solution for the Ethereum network.
