Dutch green fabrics firm Waste2Wear is launching the worldâ€™s first collection of fabrics made from ocean plastics traceable via blockchain today.

First revealed on Aug. 20, the collection was specially developed by Waste2Wear in a move to follow customer demand for traceability of recycled materials used in fabrics.

The company announced the launch of a beta version of its proprietary blockchain system for its new collection of ocean plastic fabrics on Aug. 22.

## 3 tons of plastics removed from the ocean each week

As noted by the company, plastic waste has to follow a long journey from the ocean in order to become a finished textile product, which requires a number of step-by-step data records.

By implementing blockchain technology, the firm intends to make the supply chain of ocean plastic fabrics fully traceable, it stated.

The plastic used for Waste2Wear Ocean Fabrics was sourced from the water and coastal areas of a small Island near Shanghai.

In cooperation with the local authorities, Waste2Wear built a business model allowing local fishermen to earn from fishing plastics from the ocean.
