# HSBC Exec at Money20/20: Blockchain, CBDCs Pose ‘Great Challenge’ to Interbank Settlement ...

A senior executive from U.K.-based bank HSBC has said that time-efficient distributed ledger technologies (DLT) and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) represent a “great challenge” to existing real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems, Cointelegraph learned at the Money20/20 conference Oct. 23.

HSBC’s Global Innovation Lead for Global Liquidity & Cash Management, Craig Ramsey, made his remarks during a panel during the Money20/20 conference in Las Vegas yesterday, which was devoted to “Digital Opportunities for Cross-Border Inter-Bank Transactions.”

When asked by moderator Robert Ruark — principal at financial services at “big four” audit firm KPMG — about which technologies HSBC is currently looking into for RGTS, Ramsey responded at first by suggesting the bank was looking at incumbent mechanisms, referring to SWIFT global payments solution, “SWIFT GPI”:

“All the incremental changes that SWIFT are doing \[were\] one of the things that we considered \[...\] they issued some statistics in May 2018 that using SWIFT GPI technology, 43 percent of those transactions were settled in 30 minutes, 90 percent \[...\] were in under 24 hours.”

Ramsay continued to say that “one of the things” being looked at in bank working groups is whether corporations really need transaction settlement in real time, or whether 30 minutes is sufficient.

As he developed his argument, Ramsay then made an apparent about-turn, saying that given that “the technology we have across \[existing\] RTGS systems needs to be replaced,” the idea of central bank issued digital currencies and distributed ledger productively “challenges \[banks’\] frame of reference.”

At Money20/20 earlier this week, experts disagreed on whether DLT such as blockchain will have benefits for payments systems more broadly.

This summer, HSBC’s compatriot, the U.K.’s central Bank of England, revealed plans to rebuild its RTGS system so that it can interface with private business and platforms using DLT.
