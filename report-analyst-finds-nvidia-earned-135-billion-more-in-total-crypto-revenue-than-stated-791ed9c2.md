Steves reportedly said in a note released on Jan. 30 that that according to his calculations, Nvidia generated about $1.95 billion in total revenue related to cryptocurrency and blockchain, noting that the official company’s statement said that it generated around $602 million over the same time period.

According to Market Insider, Steves assumed Nvidia had a 75 percent market share of GPUs sold for mining purposes, while IT company AMD controlled the rest.

AMD’s aforementioned report, released on Jan. 29, noted that the company expects the revenue of the first quarter to be approximately $1.25 billion, which is down 24 percent compared to the previous years.

According to the article, Steves suggests AMD’s report implied the company had $234 million in the first quarter of last year, which matches about one-quarter of the total crypto revenue, which would be in line with his calculations.

When Nvidia released its earnings report for the third quarter of last year in November 2018, the founder and CEO of the company Jensen Huang said that the company’s “near-term results reflect excess channel inventory post the cryptocurrency boom, which will be corrected.”

As Cointelegraph reported last month, Nvidia decreased its financial estimates for Q4 for the fiscal year of 2019, citing the decline in mining alongside weaker gaming and data center sales as the causes.

Also, at the end of December of last year, a class action lawsuit was launched against Nvidia over the losses reported by the company when lower crypto prices diminished demand for GPUs by miners.
