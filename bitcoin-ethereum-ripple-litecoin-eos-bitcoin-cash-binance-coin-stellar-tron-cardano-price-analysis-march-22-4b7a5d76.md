# Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, EOS, Bitcoin Cash, Binance Coin, Stellar, Tron, Cardano: Price Analysis, March 22 ...

###### 2019-03-22 14:03

On the other hand, if the pair bounces off the current levels, it can move up to $0.33108, above which a rally to the resistance line of the channel is probable.

On a breakdown of the 20-day EMA, the LTC/USD pair can correct to the 50-day SMA.

If the BCH/USD pair rebounds sharply from the current levels or from the 20-day EMA and breaks out of $163.89, it can rally to $175 and above it to $220.

## BNB/USD

Profit booking in Binance Coin (BNB) pushed its price below the uptrend line, but the bulls are currently attempting to defend the 20-day EMA and push the price back above the uptrend line.

A fall below the 20-day EMA will weaken the BNB/USD pair that can drag it to the 50-day SMA.

If the XLM/USD pair breaks down of the 20-day EMA, it can drop to the 50-day SMA.

Conversely, if the pair bounces off the 20-day EMA, it can move up to the resistance line.
