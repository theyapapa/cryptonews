Brian Kelly, the founder and CEO of digital currency investment firm BKCM LLC, said that the next Bitcoin (BTC) target is going to be $6,000, CNBC reported on April 2.

During an interview on CNBC’s “Futures Now” show, Kelly stated that “probably a reasonable target \[for Bitcoin\] is close to $6,000 for this move.”

Kelly’s statement comes in the wake of a price surge elast night when the leading coin skyrocketed by over 15 percent and broke the $5,000 price mark for the first time since last November.

According to CNBC, the price surge reportedly followed a 20,000 BTC buy across multiple exchanges, or 0.11 percent of the total Bitcoin supply of 17,620,525 BTC at press time.

In February, Kelly said in an interview with Cointelegraph that Bitcoin was 50 percent undervalued at the time.

Last month, Arthur Hayes, another cryptocurrency bull and CEO of digital currency trading platform BitMEX, predicted that Bitcoin will get back to the $10,000 price point this year.

At press time, Bitcoin is trading around $4,790, having gained more than 15 percent over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.
