# Bitcoin Cash Hard Fork Battle: Who Is Winning the Hash War ...

###### 2018-11-18 18:11

The latest Bitcoin Cash (BCH) network update has resulted in a complex battle, and the blockchain has been split into two: BCH ABC is in one corner, and BCH SV is in the other.

As a result, BCH community was split into three fractions: Bitcoin ABC, Bitcoin Unlimited, and Bitcoin SV.

Bitcoin SV (Satoshi’s Vision), on the other hand, was founded on August 16 — not long before the fateful hard fork — by a blockchain development firm affiliated with Craig Wright, who has previously declared himself as Satoshi Nakamoto.

Essentially, that proposition suggested the ability to change both Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin SV, thus empowering miners with their vote during the hard fork.

Roger Ver’s mining pool Bitcoin.com also reportedly announced that it will be redirecting hash power from BTC to BCH ABC, albeit only for one day.

According to statistics from Bitcoin Cash data aggregator Coin Dance, BCH ABC is two blocks ahead of its rival, BCH SV, as of press time, although the juxtaposition briefly changed in favor of BCH SV at some point.

On Nov. 16, Binance exchange broke the silence, having completed the distribution of both Bitcoin Cash ABC (BCHABC) and Bitcoin Cash SV (BCHSV) to its customers on a 1:1 ratio, and opened trading on both pairs.
