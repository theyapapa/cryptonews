Coinomi Wallet denied recent claims that its software sends wallet recovery seed phrases to Googleâ€™s remote spell checker servers in plain (unencrypted) text.

Coinomi notes that the phrase was only transmitted if the user chose to restore his wallet and only on the desktop version.

The cause of the problem was reportedly a bad configuration in a plug-in software contained in the desktop version of Coinomi wallets.

The company claims that on Feb. 22 Warith Al Maawali created a support request on their board regarding a vulnerability contained in their wallet which, according to Maawali, has led to a wallet being hacked, as he claims on the dedicated website AvoidCoinomi.

Per Leoussis , Coinomi responded that the company did not consider this to be a responsible disclosure and asked for details concerning the alleged vulnerability.

On Feb. 26 Coinomi purportedly declared that the company will report the stolen assets to Chainalysis, which will blacklist the funds so no exchange will accept them.

The Ledger team also claimed that the alleged vulnerabilities discovered in its hardware wallets were not critical.
