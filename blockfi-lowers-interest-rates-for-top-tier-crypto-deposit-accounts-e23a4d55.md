# BlockFi Lowers Interest Rates for Top Tier Crypto Deposit Accounts ...

Crypto wealth management and lending company BlockFi has lowered the interest rates for their biggest cryptocurrency deposit accounts, according to an official blog post on March 22.

BlockFi launched the BlockFi Interest Accounts (BIA), cryptocurrency accounts supporting Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC), earlier in March.

The accounts initially offered a 6.2 percent annual interest paid monthly in crypto.

The company’s further analysis showed that almost 75 percent of the clients have a balance of less than 5 BTC or 150 ETH, while the median account balance is $7,000.

Per the recent announcement, balances of up to or including 25 BTC or 500 ETH will still earn the 6.2 percent annual percentage yield interest rate, while all balances over that limit will reportedly earn a 2 percent rate starting on April 1.

Following its launch, BlockFi’s product faced a critical reaction from some industry players, specifically due to the company’s terms and conditions that allow it to determine the interest rate each month at its sole discretion, according to Bloomberg.

Commenting on the critics, Zac Prince, chief executive of BlockFi, told Bloomberg:

“We didn’t launch with a 6 percent rate with the intention of changing it one month later and pulling a big gotcha on everybody.
