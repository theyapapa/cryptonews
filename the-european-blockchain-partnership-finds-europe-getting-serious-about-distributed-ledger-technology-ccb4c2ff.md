# The European Blockchain Partnership Finds Europe Getting Serious About Distributed Ledger Technology ...

Including the UK, France, Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands and Ireland, they committed themselves to "cooperate in the establishment of a European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI) that will support the delivery of cross-border digital public services, with the highest standards of security and privacy."

As a member, it has committed itself to helping to identify, by the end of 2018, "an initial set of cross-border digital public sector services that could be deployed through the European Blockchain Services Infrastructure."

The European Commission's head of Digital Innovation and Blockchain, PÄ“teris Zilgalvis explains:

"The Partnership's mission is defined in the Joint Declaration and it is on that mandate that we have to deliver before the end of the year.

"As stated in the Joint Declaration, by end of 2018 the Partnership must provide a set of use cases of cross-border digital public services that could be deployed through the EBSI, a set of functional and technical specifications for the EBSI and finally, a governance model describing how the EBSI will be managed."

"We will have three monthly meetings by the end of this year during which we will have to agree not only on use-cases but also technical/functional requirements and governance model for European blockchain infrastructure," he says, his use of "not only" implying that the Partnership has a more-than sizeable workload to get through before Christmas.

"In the longer term, we would like EBSI to become a global reference when it comes to trusted blockchain infrastructures," admits Zilgalvis, "a 'gold standard' infrastructure that is governed through a transparent multi-stakeholder organisation, meets the most advanced cybersecurity and energy efficiency standards, is scalable to accommodate different use cases, is highly-performant in terms of speed and throughput, ensures the continuity of services on the long term, integrates eIDAS (electronic IDentification, Authentication and trust Services) and supports full compliance with the EU requirements on data protection (General Data Protection Regulation) and network information security."

But even if certain differences of opinion may need to be ironed out between members before implementation can begin, the target of 2019 shows just how confident the European Commission is that the Partnership's member states are on the same page with regards to blockchain, which is further indicated by them signing its Declaration in the first place.
