Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have been generating a buzz in the crypto world for some time — and now, a conference is being established where enthusiasts and entrepreneurs can delve deeper into these digital assets, exploring the latest trends and uncovering new opportunities in the market.

Other talks are going to focus on getting mainstream gamers excited about non-fungible tokens, how these assets could reimagine philanthropy, NFTs’ potential in reshaping the sports experience for fans, and the process of tokenizing real-world assets on the blockchain.

## The 411 on NFTs

Non-fungible tokens have attracted interest because they are different from the fungible assets commonly used by the crypto community and the fiat world today.

Lumi Collect is a crypto wallet for NFTs, and the company has sought to both educate users on its potential while giving them a way to store all of their tokens in one place.

## “Leading names and brands in blockchain”

At the PlayStation Theater, NFT NYC is planning to bring together key players in this burgeoning industry — including financial influencers who believe that non-fungible tokens have the potential to “drive the next wave of blockchain value.”

One of the sectors that has enjoyed some success with non-fungible tokens already is the collectibles industry.

NFTs can be used to represent real-world items, such as pieces of art, but pioneering startups like CryptoKitties have also created a new class of digital kittens that can be bought, sold and collected through a decentralized marketplace.
