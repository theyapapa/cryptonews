The captains regent of the Republic of San Marino, Nicola Selva and Michele Muratori, have issued a governmental decree on blockchain tech for businesses, according to a recent document.

The new decree outlines procedures for registering a blockchain-based organization with the “Istituto per l’Innovazione della Repubblica di San Marino,” or San Marino Innovation Institute.

According to the decree, blockchain-based organizations in the Republic of San Marino, the EU, or any country not classified as “high risk” and also considered relevant to the purview of San Marino legislation, may apply for registration with the institute.

The institute sets out to provide regulatory certainty, as well as supervision and enforcement of those regulations — and an anti-money laundering (AML) policy — particularly for initial token offerings (ITOs or ICOs).

The institute distinguishes between utility tokens and security tokens with respect to ITOs, which are defined as follows:

”Utility tokens … shall be regarded as vouchers for the purchase of services or goods offered by the Blockchain Entity… Security tokens … shall be digital assets which represent, alternatively, depending on the underlying instrument: a) participating instruments of the issuer; b) debt securities of the issuer.”

The decree also includes tax policies for utility tokens and security tokens.

Utility tokens, notably, will be treated as foreign currency for tax purposes.
