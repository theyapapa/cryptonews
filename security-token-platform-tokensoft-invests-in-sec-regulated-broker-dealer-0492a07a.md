Security tokens platform TokenSoft Inc. has invested in a company that is purportedly a United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)-compliant broker-dealer, according to a press release published Dec. 13.

TokenSoft is a platform that provides a suite of technology and security products for the sale, issuance, and management of security tokens and other digital assets.

Security tokens often promise investment returns and value appreciation, in addition to allowing holders to purchase goods and services.

The investment enables TokenSoft to offer issuers the choice to host a token sale themselves or work with a broker-dealer to manage the token sale on their behalf.

Mason Borda, CEO of TokenSoft, commented on the investment:

"As a result of rapidly growing interest in the security token market, we have been inundated with requests for broker-dealer support services.

With this investment, we are building a one-stop-shop for digital asset issuance and management â€” enabling us to expand our security and compliance support to every stage of a digital asset's lifecycle."

Last week, Thai cryptocurrency exchange Satang Corp. announced plans to raise nearly $10 million in a security token offering (STO).
