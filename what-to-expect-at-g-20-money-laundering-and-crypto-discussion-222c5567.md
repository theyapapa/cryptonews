# What to Expect at G-20: Money Laundering and Crypto Discussion ...

One of the main themes to be discussed at the G-20 Financial Ministers and Central Governors Meeting this weekend has to do with money laundering and cryptocurrency.

He summarized the FATF draft as an agreement in the industry that “certain standards, including proper Know Your Customer (KYC), enhanced due diligence (EDD), transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting are necessary to combat money laundering”

The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is an intergovernmental body formed to fight money laundering and combat the financing of terrorism.

According to Alexander Zaidelson, the CEO of a privacy coin-centered Beam, the governments “may eventually strengthen the regulatory scrutiny to on- and off-ramps, i.e. places where cryptocurrency can be converted into Fiat currency, mostly exchanges” He also added that there also may be an “attack” on unregulated exchanges.

Although it is possible that the regulators could make it difficult to convert fully anonymous coins to fiat, Zaidelson argues that privacy coins’ opt-in compliance can deal with that case.

## Money laundering, Privacy, and Public Interest

“I think that privacy is a basic human right,” according to Zaidelson, which he thinks is something to keep in mind when talking about money laundering.

Spiro of Chainalysis thinks of the balance between money laundering and privacy in terms of “public interest and safety.”

What they can do instead is know “a particular address belongs to a customer at that exchange, not who the customer is”

It might be worthwhile checking what the G-20 agreement this weekend might imply for the balance between privacy and money laundering.
