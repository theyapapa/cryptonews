A project called Nasdacoin is planning to open a new online marketplace where users can buy and sell products, as well as services to each other, directly using the companyâ€™s cryptocurrency as a payment method.

Nasdacoin (NSD) would be the main currency for buying chips and getting awards for this service.

For users that want to exchange NSD directly to fiat currency and withdraw it, the company is developing a Nasdacoin Card.

## Opportunities with NSD

Nasdacoin is a virtual cryptocurrency that was developed using the script algorithm in the POW/POS Hybrid format.

The company says that anybody can get the Nasdacoin cryptocurrency using Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mining.

Users need to acquire a certain amount of NSD and keep that digital money in their Nasdacoin wallet for a minimum of 15 days and a maximum of 90 days, until these coins start to mine new blocks.

The Nasdacoin team hopes that new features and its Affiliate Program will help create a strong internal community, and make Nasdacoin one of the major currencies on the digital market in a very short period of time.
