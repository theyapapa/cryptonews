###### 2019-02-06 03:02

Twitter co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey has joined a community project demonstrating the functionality of Bitcoin’s (BTC) second-layer scaling protocol, the Lightning Network (LN), on Feb. 5.

Dorsey, who has repeatedly pledged his faith in Bitcoin becoming the de facto currency of the internet, is now participating in an experiment dubbed LN Trust Chain, a chain of transactions on the LN that began circulating Jan. 19.

Dorsey — who is also the founder and CEO of mobile payments company Square — was nominated as a participat by entrepreneur and regular Bitcoin commentator Matt Odell in a tweet Feb. 4.

Having posted his invoice to Odell — currently the standard method of participating in the Trust Chain — publicly on Twitter, Dorsey received considerable praise from other well-known community sources.

“This will become one of the most historic tweets by @jack \[Jack Dorsey\],” a Bitcoin proponent known on Twitter as Armin Van Bitcoin responded, adding:

“And so, we begin the era of #BitcoinTwitter #BT\[.

In a separate tweet Feb. 5, Dorsey revealed that the only cryptocurrency he holds currently is Bitcoin.

In a recent interview, Dorsey declared that he believes Bitcoin will be the internet’s native currency, a claim he has made before.
