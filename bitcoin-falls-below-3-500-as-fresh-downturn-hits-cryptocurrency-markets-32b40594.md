While no single event appeared to trigger the losses, analysts had long called for further downsides for Bitcoin, with Cointelegraph reporting on warnings from veteran forecaster Tone Vays during December’s lows which put put BTC/USD at $1,300.

In altcoin markets, following a common theme of mimicking and then expanding on Bitcoin trends, some assets in the top twenty by market cap fell sharply.

Ethereum (ETH) had lost 6.8 percent at press time to trade at $108, while the listings were led by Bitcoin Cash (BCH), which shed 10.8 percent to hit $111.

Bitcoin SV, the hard fork of BCH that traditionally traded inversely with BTC, failed to replicate its previous behavior, falling 9 percent to $66.80 — a two-month low.
