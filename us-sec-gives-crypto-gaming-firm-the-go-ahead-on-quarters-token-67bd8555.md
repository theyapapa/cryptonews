# US SEC Gives Crypto Gaming Firm the Go-Ahead on ‘Quarters’ Token ...

###### 2019-07-25 19:07

The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has cleared a crypto gaming company to issue blockchain tokens without registration, deeming the tokens to not be securities.

The SEC published its determination on July 25 via the commission’s website, as a reply to an apparent inquiry from the company Pocketful of Quarters (PoQ) on its proposed “Quarters” tokens.

Jonathan Ingram, the chief legal advisor of the SEC’s FinHub division wrote:

“Based on the facts presented, the Division will not recommend enforcement action to the Commission if, in reliance on your opinion as counsel that the Quarters are not securities, PoQ offers and sells the Quarters without registration under Section 5 of the Securities Act and does not register Quarters as a class of equity securities under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act.”

This includes the stipulation that “PoQ will market and sell Quarters to gamers solely for consumptive use as a means of accessing and interacting with Participating Games.”

## Crypto Rewards in Gaming

According to its website, PoQ purports to offer “great prizes” for scrim competitions in popular games such as PUBG, Fortnite, and CSGO.

On its investment page, PoQ specifies that investors receive a portion of Quarter sales royalties in Ether (ETH), and can claim them via a smart contract.

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, a company focused on offering crypto rewards in the gaming sector, Refereum, has announced that it is running a promotional campaign in the popular battle royale game PUBG.
