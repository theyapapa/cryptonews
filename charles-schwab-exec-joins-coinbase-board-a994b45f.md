Chris Dodds, who serves on the board of directors of the Charles Schwab Corporation, has joined cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase's board of directors, according to an announcement published October 2.

The Charles Schwab Corporation is a brokerage, banking and financial advisory services firm based in San Francisco.

In addition to the Coinbase board, Dodds will reportedly contribute to the exchange’s expansion in terms of financial services capabilities.

At Charles Schwab, Dodds has worked as VP of corporate finance and mergers and acquisitions, as well as treasurer.

Dodds’ joining Coinbase is the latest in a series of talent acquisitions by the San Francisco-based crypto exchange and wallet services provider.

Last month, Coinbase hired former Fannie Mae General Counsel Brian Brooks as their new Chief Legal Officer, who will be responsible for legal, compliance, and government affairs.

In August, former Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft employee Tim Wagner joined Coinbase as VP of engineering, while in July the exchange announced that ex-Pershing exec Jeff Horowitz will join the company as Chief Compliance Officer.
