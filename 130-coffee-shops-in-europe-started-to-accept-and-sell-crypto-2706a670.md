A “technology enabler” startup known as Cyclebit is aiming to simplify things by enabling stores to serve as “cryptocurrency gateways” – enticing crypto enthusiasts to come and spend their coins with them and inject some new funds into the economy.

According to the print version of the Spanish business newspaper Expansión from 16 Oct 2018, the crypto payment technology is being rolled out in Nostrum – a network of 130 coffee shops throughout Spain – which has just started accepting and selling Bitcoin.

## Using a working ecosystem

Unlike some of the other startups in this space, Cyclebit says it already has access to a working ecosystem provided by Ibox – an omnichannel payment platform that has an annual turnover of $1 billion.

Ultimately, Cyclebit hopes to make every point-of-sale device capable of accepting crypto payments, and its team has amassed experience in building large payment networks.

Merchants would be given a “ready-to-install, free customizable app for iOS and Android which is able to accept payments from crypto wallets as well as old-fashioned banks.

Cyclebit says most shoppers find the idea of crypto payments as “prohibitively complex as obtaining crypto in the first place” – and passionately argues that this must change.

## Gaining momentum

Work is continuing to develop Cyclebit’s core product: a complete ecosystem for crypto ownership and payments that supports an array of cryptocurrencies and popular altcoins.
