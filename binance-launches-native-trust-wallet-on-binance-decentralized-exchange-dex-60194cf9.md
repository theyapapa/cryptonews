Binance, the world’s second largest crypto exchange by adjusted volume, has released its official Trust Wallet on its decentralized trading platform Binance DEX.

As previously reported, Binance acquired Trust Wallet — an open source, decentralized wallet that initially offered native support for ethereum (ETH) and ETH-based tokens — in summer 2018.

At the time, Binance had revealed its plans to list the wallet as the default wallet on its forthcoming decentralized exchange (DEX) — then still under development.

According to today’s press release, the integrated Trust Wallet will help support Binance DEX users wishing to maintain custody and full control over their funds, while benefiting from fast trading services.

Aside from serving as a wallet, Trust Wallet also provides users with access to decentralized applications (DApps) that can be accessed via the wallet’s mobile or desktop version, the press release notes.

Desktop support is offered via the WalletConnect open protocol, which connects DApps to mobile wallets using end-to-end encryption and was integrated with Trust Wallet and Binance DEX this May.

According to the press release, Trust Wallet plans to launch support for layer-2 payment protocols such as Lightning Network in future, as well as support for staking services.
