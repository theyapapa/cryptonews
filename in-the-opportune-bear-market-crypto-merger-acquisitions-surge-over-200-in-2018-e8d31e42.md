# In the ‘Opportune’ Bear Market, Crypto Merger & Acquisitions Surge Over 200% in 2018 ...

In what has been dubbed a “deal frenzy,” crypto and blockchain-related merger and acquisition (M&A) activity has surged by over 200 percent in 2018, CNBC reported Oct. 18.

Data compiled by JMP Securities for PitchBook reportedly reveals that the total number of M&A deals in the sector is set to hit 145 by the end of this year, with 115 already closed as of Oct. 15.

The data covers a wide gamut of M&A deals, including majority investments, partial and full acquisitions.

JMP Securities' head of blockchain and digital assets investment banking, Satya Bajpai, told CNBC in an interview that the so-called “crypto winter” presents an opportune moment for those eyeing access to innovative tech, intellectual property and talent in the emerging space.

Bajpai further characterized the heightened deal activity as something of a “land grab,” whereby the rapid pace of innovation in the sector pushes parties to opt for buying instead of starting from scratch:

“"\[The M&A route is\] expensive, but you get the technology and product immediately.

Moreover, M&A offer a short-cut to access an existing user base or community, Bajpai suggests, contributing to the perception that M&A deals are “the most viable and fastest way to grow” in the new space.

Other commentators have expressed similar views that the bear market is viewed as a favorable moment for institutional entry into the space; commenting on Twitter earlier this month, venture capital investor Garry Tan argued that the “crypto winter \[…\] makes it safer for super-long-term oriented Yale-model institutions to enter at a price that isn’t dangerous.”
