Major cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex is looking to launch the USDT stablecoin operated by sister firm Tether on the Lightning Network (LN), crypto news outlet The Block reported on May 31.

Per the report, Bitfinex’s chief technology officer Paolo Ardoino told the outlet that the company plans to launch USDT on LN later this year.

To pursue this objective, the firm reportedly joined the RGB open source development project.

’” The Block also cited Ardoino commenting on the development, saying it is “one of the coolest things” the firm has participated in thus far.

The company’s CTO further noted Bitfinex wants to contribute to the LN’s development.

A post released by Tether in April 2017 shows that the company already had such plans for the stablecoin at the time.

As Cointelegraph reported earlier this week, Tether has announced that it is partnering with EOS parent company Block.one to release its stablecoin on the EOS blockchain.
