United States President Donald Trump has appointed vocal Bitcoin supporter Mick Mulvaney as the new White House chief of staff.

## From ‘horrible human being’ to golf partner: Mulvaney’s relationship with Trump

In 2010, Mulvaney was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives as a South Carolina member of the tea party movement.

Around the same time, Mulvaney was said to have made “a name for himself on Capitol Hill” as a founder of the House Freedom Caucus and opposed government funding measures, debt limit increases, and bipartisan budget agreements.

Mulvaney has become the third chief of staff in just two years, after Trump struggled to close the position.

A senior White House representative reportedly told The Washington Post that Trump grew “deeply frustrated at the rejections and the media narrative that no one of high stature wanted to be his chief of staff.”

According to the Washington Post, Mulvaney had told Trump he wanted to become chief of staff at a private dinner previously this year, adding that he would “manage the staff but not the president.”
