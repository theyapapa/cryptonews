United Kingdom-based trading platform eToro has conducted a successful trial of issuing tokenized assets on Facebook’s Libra protocol.

According to a Github repository detailing its activities, eToroX, the firm’s recently-launched innovation and research offshoot, managed to debut its eToken on Libra.

eToken is the technology behind eToro’s tokenized assets, with researchers explaining they wished to test Libra’s current capabilities in the first week of its existence.

“By exploring Libra’s capabilities, and using Move IR (the intermediary representative layer of what will eventually be the final programming language), they successfully managed to implement an initial version of eToro tokenized assets on the Libra Network,” the blog post confirmed.

As Cointelegraph reported, Libra forms Facebook’s first major stab at creating a cryptocurrency ecosystem.

Cryptocurrency industry figures have also released appraisals of Libra as a cryptocurrency, which sharply criticize its technical characteristics.

“We applaud the early initiatives of the Libra team in designing Move IR, and are excited to follow the development in the near future,” Dr. Omri Ross, eToroX’s chief blockchain scientist, concluded in separate comments.
