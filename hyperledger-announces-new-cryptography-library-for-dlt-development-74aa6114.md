# Hyperledger Announces New ‘Cryptography Library’ for DLT Development ...

###### 2018-12-04 22:12

The Hyperledger Technical Steering Committee has approved the Ursa project, a modular cryptography software library, according to an official announcement Dec. 4.

According to the statement, as Hyperledger has matured, projects “have started to find a need for sophisticated cryptographic implementations.”

The post describes Ursa as a shift from having each project implementing its own protocols to collaborating on a shared library.

Ursa is meant to avoid wasted work on duplicate projects, enhancing security by simplifying analysis and making it “less likely for less experienced people to create their own less secure implementations.”

Furthermore, the project is supposed to grant “the ability to enforce expert review of all cryptographic code” and simplify cross-platform interoperability since multiple projects would use the same libraries.

Hyperledger states that with the new library “blockchain developers can choose and modify their cryptographic schemes with a simple configuration file.”

Hyperledger expects that Ursa will ease development since “it is easier for new projects to get off the ground if they have easy access to well-implemented, modular cryptographic abstractions.”
