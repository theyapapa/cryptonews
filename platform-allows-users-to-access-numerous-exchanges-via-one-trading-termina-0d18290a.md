A startup based in Kyiv, Ukraine says its trading terminal Superorder, which is powered by automation features, can aggregate crypto trades across multiple exchanges, allowing investors to centralise their trading activities.

## Superorder: Redefining trading terminals

According to the developers, Superorder is a “next generation trading terminal,” which provides users with centralized trading on any exchange from a single place.

While the startup says the terminal provides access to a wide array of exchanges, the platform currently supports only Bittrex, Coinbase and Malta-based Binance.

According to its press release, the trading terminal works by connecting to a chosen exchange's API, which allows Superorder to interact with the platform on behalf of the user.

## Strategy builder and chart timeframes

The platform has some features that it believes will attract professional traders.

Superorder says the strategy builder is the primary feature that demonstrates the platform’s commitment to automation and simplicity.

Superorder says its trading terminal can gather data from various exchanges to ensure that the users are always up to speed regarding the value of their digital assets.
