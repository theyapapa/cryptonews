The startup that has built a “next-generation crypto trading terminal” says its product is focused on simplicity and automation — enabling traders to set up their strategies and spend evenings away from their screens.

In the spirit of compatibility, the Kyiv-based startup says its terminals give traders the opportunity to trade on any exchange from one place.

While novice traders benefit from a user-friendly interface that sets things out visually to avoid confusion — along with support from a like-minded community — experienced traders have the opportunity to adjust the terminal’s settings in line with their own personal preferences.

The terminal offers a total of nine building blocks that traders can choose from when developing their strategies.

As well as limit and market orders, where cryptocurrencies can be bought and sold at a predetermined price or instantly at market rates, a stop-loss function helps to insulate traders against heavy losses.

According to Superorder, its trading terminal has the capacity to handle a multitude of strategies simultaneously, even if they lie across different exchanges and coin pairings.

## An advanced side

Superorder says that it has been striving to add advanced tools in a bid to make its terminals attractive to professional traders.
