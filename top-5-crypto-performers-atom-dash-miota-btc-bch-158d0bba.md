# Top 5 Crypto Performers: ATOM, DASH, MIOTA, BTC, BCH ...

###### 2019-05-05 21:05

While markets have looked bullish this week following a sharp surge May 3, traders need to watch out for a correction in the next few days.

## ATOM/USD

Atom (ATOM), the native crypto asset of the Cosmos blockchain, made an impressive start as it made a place for itself among the top 15 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization within a very short span of time.

However, while the initial response has been bullish, can the momentum continue in the best performing major cryptocurrency of the past week or is it time to take some chips off the table?

A rally above this resistance can push the price to $5.9139, which is the 50% retracement level.

## DASH/USD

The recovery in market prices pushed the mining hashrate of Dash (DASH) to an all-time high of 3.2385 petahashes on April 19, bettering its previous record of 3.237 petahashes set in early November 2018.

The DASH/USD pair corrected to the breakout level of the range in the week before this past one.

## BTC/USD

Bitcoin (BTC) prices have risen sharply over the past seven days.
