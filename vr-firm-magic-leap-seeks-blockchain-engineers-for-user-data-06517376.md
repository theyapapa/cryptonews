Virtual reality (VR) startup Magic Leap is seeking blockchain engineers according to recent listings on employment website Greenhouse.

The firm is looking for a senior blockchain architect and blockchain engineers.

Among the duties listed for the senior blockchain architect position, the individual will be “planning and execution of a portfolio of blockchain, smart contract, and Ricardian contract technologies in support of the implementation of our Lifestream business function.”

In a recent interview with VR industry publication UploadVR, Magic Leap CEO Rony Abovitz said that Lifestream is: “all the data that you experience and the data of the world around you and how that needs to be protected…” At a conference last October, he noted the importance of protecting the data set, which he characterized as critical.

The job listing seeks an individual with experience in the Red Belly and Hyperledger blockchain frameworks and experience with Java, Node,js, Python or Go.

Magic Leap also prefers that the engineer has experience writing smart contracts for blockchain networks like Hyperledger Fabric, Hyperledger Sawtooth, Ethereum and Corda.

Crunchbase reported last year that the firm is the top-funded VR startup on the market, having aggregated 41% of VC funding in the VR market worldwide in 2018.
