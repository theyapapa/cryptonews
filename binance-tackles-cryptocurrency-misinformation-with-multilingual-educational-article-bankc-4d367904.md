# Binance Tackles Cryptocurrency ‘Misinformation’ With Multilingual Educational Article Bank ...

###### 2018-12-12 02:12

Cryptocurrency exchange Binance has launched a collection of educational content comprising almost 500 articles in order to fight “incorrect” and “misleading” information, a press release confirmed Dec. 12.

The launch and development is a product of Binance Academy, the exchange’s dedicated education arm which itself began operating in August.

People are frequently quoting articles that are either incorrect or are misleading,” Ted Lin, chief growth officer at Binance commented in the release.

Lin noted:

“With Binance Academy, our goal is to provide an entirely neutral platform with quality, unbiased, educational information.”

While it remains unknown what specific information will be covered, topics will include blockchain, security and economics, as well as “useful tutorials and guides,” Lin added.

Developing such resources has also become an occupation of various other entities in the cryptocurrency industry and beyond, October seeing a government-endorsed scheme by Gibraltar to develop blockchain education courses.

Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin’s ConsenSys — a blockchain startup and incubator — in partnership with online education platform Coursera, along with Oxford University professors, have also put forward separate blockchain educational plans of their own.
