Ripple will lead a group of crypto startups to lobby lawmakers and financial regulators in D.C. to support crypto and blockchain innovation, Bloomberg reported on Thursday, September 27.

According to the report, the coalition of San-Francisco-based crypto firms is planning to pay Klein/Johnson Group, a bipartisan lobby group, to assist the crypto and blockchain community in conveying to regulators that the industry needs support from the government.

The new group, called the Securing America’s Internet of Value Coalition, aims to soften the government’s stance in order to encourage innovation and support competition in the ecosystem of global crypto markets.

The coalition, together with the lobby group, will raise issues with Congress, as well as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and other agencies that have relations to cryptocurrencies.

Along with Ripple, as well as independent foundation RippleWorks, the coalition will also feature digital payments firm Coil, crypto investment company Yaka, and PolySign, a startup that is set to launch a crypto custodian.

The companies’ lobbying move follows the increased attention of Congress and other agencies like the SEC towards cryptocurrencies.

Yesterday, a group of Congress lawmakers sent a letter to the SEC, urging the regulators to provide more clarity in regard to cryptocurrencies.
