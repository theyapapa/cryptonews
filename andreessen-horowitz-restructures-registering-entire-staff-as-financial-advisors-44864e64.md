American venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz is restructuring by registering all of its employees as qualified financial advisors, Forbes reported on April 2.

Andreessen Horowitz — a Silicon Valley company specializing in investing mostly in technology and financial services startups, having raised $1.7 billion across seven funds — told Forbes that it is registering their all 150 employees as financial advisors, which renounces the company’s status as a venture capital firm entirely.

“If the firm wants to put $1 billion into cryptocurrency or tokens, or buy unlimited shares in public companies or from other investors, it can.

This spring, Andreessen Horowitz reportedly gave up its venture capital exemptions and registered as a financial advisor.

Last September, Andreessen Horowitz invested $15 million in blockchain startup MakerDAO (MKR).

Andreessen Horowitz via its investment fund a16z acquired 6 percent of the total MKR token supply.

In June of last year, Andreessen Horowitz hired Katie Haun as its first female general investing partner to run the company’s newly formed $300 million cryptocurrency fund.
