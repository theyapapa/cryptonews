United States Treasury undersecretary Sigal Mandelker stated that cryptocurrencies could become “the next frontier” in the war on terrorism.

According to a press release published on the U.S. Treasury’s website on Sept. 11, Mandelker made her remarks during the 19th annual international conference on counterterrorism.

## Cash is still predominant

While Mandelker admitted that most terrorist organizations still rely on various traditional means of financing such as cash, she also said that she believes crypto could become “the next frontier”:

“Terrorist organizations and their supporters and sympathizers are constantly looking for new ways to raise and transfer funds without detection or tracking by law enforcement.

While most terrorist groups still primarily rely on the traditional financial system and cash to transfer funds, without the appropriate strong safeguards cryptocurrencies could become the next frontier.”

Mandelker added:

“While this may not seem like a lot of money, a FinCEN analysis found remittances linked to terrorism averaged less than $600 per transaction.

## Non-compliant networks won’t survive

According to Mandelker, she recognizes that cryptocurrencies are developments in the field of value transmission that require a “tremendous amount of energy and expertise.”

Mandelker added:

“Absent appropriate safeguards to keep our nations and our communities safe from terrorists, rogue regimes, and others who threaten us, the U.S. will work with governments around the world to make sure that non-compliant networks and fintechs do not survive.”
