Law enforcement in Mumbai, India have exposed a group allegedly involved in a cryptocurrency scam that amassed an estimated 1 billion rupees (nearly $17 million), local media outlet The Times of India reports on Feb. 17.

According to The Times of India, the police are also looking for a fifth suspect, Ashok Goyal, who reportedly played a key role in the alleged scam.

The complaint that led to the four arrests was filed by a resident of the Indian city of Surat, Umeshchand Jain, who alleged that suspects defrauded him of 10.2 million rupees (about $145,000).

The articles quotes police inspector Sunil Jadhav explaining the scheme:

“The accused held meetings in Mumbai, Surat, and other parts of Gujarat, and lured people into investing their hard-earned money by promising to double it in two months.

According to the report, the group launched a cryptocurrency dubbed “Cashcoin” a year ago, which they then sold to investors, promising them to double their investments.

Last month, Indian police also arrested an associate of a group accused of conducting a crypto scam involving 5 billion rupees (about $71.6 million).

A report published by crypto analytics company Chainalysis in January revealed that the value of Ethereum (ETH) stolen via scams reached $36 million 2018, more than doubling in 2018, as compared to 2017.
