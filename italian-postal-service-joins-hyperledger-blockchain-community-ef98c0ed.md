The Italian postal service provider, Poste Italiane, has joined the Hyperledger blockchain community, Cointelegraph Italia reported on Jan. 29.

Hyperledger is a collaborative project led by the Linux Foundation which aims to create open-source standards for blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT).

Poste Italiane stated in a press release that joining Hyperledger is consistent with the service’s Deliver 2022 Business Plan.

Part of the plan involves the acquisition and acceleration of new technology in the agency’s operations.

The announcement draws particular attention to data protection, stating that blockchain technology is “an effective response to the problems of security, transparency, interoperability and privacy.”

FedEx CEO Fred Smith has previously stated that blockchain technology has “big, big implications” for supply chains.

Last week, a committee in the Italian Senate approved an amendment on blockchain industry regulation, which provides definitions for DLT-based technologies and smart contracts.
