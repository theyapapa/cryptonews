# Dave Rubin Turns to Bitcoin for Crowdfunding After Alleged Patreon Censorship ...

American libertarian political commentator Dave Rubin has announced he is turning to Bitcoin (BTC) in lieu of the crowdfunding platform Patreon, in protest against the latter’s alleged censorship practices.

In an interview with the Washington Examiner last week, Rubin explained his decision to leave Patreon — which reportedly accounts for “between 60-70 percent” of his funding — as taking “a stand against the ever-moving encroachment on free speech, on free expression” on mainstream platforms.

The Rubin Report has earned a reputation for its illustrious array of controversial guests and for its critique of what Rubin styles as the failures of today’s “regressive left,” in particular the latter’s allegedly inordinate, “illiberal” concern for political correctness.

While social media networks such as Facebook and Twitter have faced mounting criticism from conservatives over the perception they excessively filter and suppress right-leaning content, Patreon is notably not a content-hosting site, but a funding platform.

In a video posted to the Rubin Report channel Jan. 3, Rubin explicitly isolated the action against Sargon as the impetus for his decision to ditch the platform in favor of a censorship-resistant form of funding — which, according to his most recent Twitter announcement, has transpired to be Bitcoin.

As reported today, controversial social media site Gab — which presents itself as a haven for uncensored speech online, but whose critics deem it to be an “echo chamber” for alt- or far-right views — has announced it is turning to Square’s Cash App to transact and receive Bitcoin (BTC) donations.

Gab’s corporate account on crypto exchange Coinbase had been closed in December, with media reports at the time citing the platform’s contentious reputation as possible grounds for closure.
