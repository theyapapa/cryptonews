# Major Indian Bank Threatens to Close Accounts of Users Transacting in Crypto: Report ...

###### 2019-01-11 17:01

Kotak Mahindra Bank — India's second largest private sector bank by market cap — is allegedly requiring account holders to refrain from dealings in cryptocurrency.

According to the screenshot provided in Indian CryptoGirl’s tweet, Kotak Mahindra Bank makes explicit reference to the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) regulations in its apparent terms and conditions for account holders, which allegedly demand consent to the following:

“Basis \[sic\] the regulations issued by RBI, I hereby declare that I will not deal with any transactions related to cryptocurrency including bitcoins.

I also understand and agree that the bank reserves all right to close my account without further intimation in case I am found to undertake such transactions.”

In April 2018, India’s central bank, the RBI prohibited all domestic banks from providing services to crypto-related businesses, but the legal status of cryptocurrencies themselves in the country remains largely undefined.

Multiple twitter users have responded to the Jan. 8 tweet by reporting further unconfirmed details of the bank’s alleged anti-crypto warnings.

One user shared a screenshot of what appears to be an ATM screen belonging to an unspecified bank — but which reproduces the exact wording of Kotak Mahindra’s warning against account closures without further intimation.

One indignant twitter user responded by rallying Indian citizens to make a national bank run, inspired by the recent calls to action from French grassroots political movement, the Gilets Jaunes (Yellow Vests).
