On October 24, Revain, a service for collecting customer reviews, released a full-scale working 1.0 version of its Ethereum-based platform.

The Revain platform was launched in order to change the process of collecting reviews from customers, by means of blockchain technology.

## Refining the Dashboard

The basic element of the Revain platform is its Dashboard, which allows startup teams to communicate with users and reward them for high-quality reviews.

Secondly, as the Revain team assures its users, a large number of quality reviews about a company will make it stand out among others in a very positive way.

“Revain AI ﬁlters out low-quality reviews and makes quality ones eligible for rewards,” reads the company’s press release.

Users are supposed to benefit from writing reviews on the Revain platform.

So far, the platform covers a few kinds of reviews: ICOs, crypto exchanges, e-commerce, as well as FMCG companies and services.
