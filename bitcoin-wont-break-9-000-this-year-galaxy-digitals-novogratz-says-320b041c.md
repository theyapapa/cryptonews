# Bitcoin Won't Break $9,000 This Year, Galaxy Digital’s Novogratz Says ...

###### 2018-10-04 08:10

Mike Novogratz, CEO of crypto investment firm Galaxy Digital Capital Management, has again corrected his Bitcoin (BTC) price forecast.

Novogratz also linked the currently declining prices to the actions of companies in the industry who are selling crypto "just to fund the burn rate of the industry."

He stressed that these companies are not earning “anywhere near” the revenues from last year's "crypto boom," which means that they are barely managing to cover salaries and operational costs.

Back in Nov. 2018, when cryptocurrency prices skyrocketed, Novogratz predicted that Bitcoin could climb as high as $45,000 within 12 months.

In summer 2018, Novogratz slightly changed his mind, stating that mass adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology was still five to six years away.

In mid-September he opined that crypto prices have hit the bottom.

However, he noted that Bitcoin’s price was still quite stable, potentially attracting investor attention.
