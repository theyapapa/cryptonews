Law enforcement in Mumbai, India have arrested four more suspects allegedly involved in a cryptocurrency scam that amassed an estimated 1 billion rupees (over $14 million).

The Times of India also states that an unnamed Bollywood actor who reportedly attended promotional events of the scam will likely be questioned as well.

As Cointelegraph reported last month, Indian law enforcement first exposed the alleged scam and arrested the first four suspects in February, but did not arrest Goyal until recently.

The first complaint that led to the prosecution was filed in Surat, a city in the Indian city of Gujarat, by an individual alleging to have been defrauded of the equivalent of nearly $150,000.

At the beginning of January, Indian police also arrested an associate of a separate group accused of conducting a crypto scam involving 5 billion rupees (about $71.6 million).

In another recently uncovered crypto scam, Morgan Rockcoons, also known as Morgan Rockwell, has pleaded guilty to two cryptocurrency-related charges in San Diego federal court.

He reportedly admitted both to selling land he didn’t have for a crypto city project dubbed “Bitcointopia” and to operating a money transmitting business without a license.
