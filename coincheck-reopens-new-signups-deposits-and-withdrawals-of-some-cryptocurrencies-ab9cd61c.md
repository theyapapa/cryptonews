Monex Group, the Japanese internet broker that purchased hacked cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck, announced it had reopened new account signups and limited trading in a statement Tuesday, Oct. 30.

The latest phase of a step-by-step reboot of Coincheck, Monex added users could also begin depositing and purchasing certain cryptocurrencies.

“...Here we announce that Coincheck has resumed ‘new account openings’ and ‘customers’ depositing and purchasing some cryptocurrencies’ services today,” the statement reads.

In future, Ethereum (ETH), NEM (XEM), Lisk (LSK), Ripple (XRP) and Factom (FCT) will return to Coincheck, “if the services are confirmed safe and become ready to be offered,” the statement adds.

For those choosing to open a new account on the platform, Monex advised a strict know-your-customer (KYC) process would be in place, in line with regulations demanded from exchanges by Japanese regulator the Financial Services Agency (FSA).

Fiscal results published by Monex yesterday, Oct. 29, revealed that Coincheck saw a 66 percent decline in revenue for Q3 2018.

Monex purchased Coincheck for around $33.5 million in April, outlining plans to relaunch the exchange in full compliance with local regulations.
