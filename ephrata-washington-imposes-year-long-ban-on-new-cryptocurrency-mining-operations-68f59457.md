# Ephrata, Washington Imposes Year-Long Ban on New Cryptocurrency Mining Operations ...

###### 2018-10-21 07:10

The city of Ephrata, Washington, will halt new crypto mining developments in the city for the next 12 months, Eastern Washington and North Idaho daily newspaper The Spokesman Review reports Friday, Oct. 19.

The recently announced suspension will only affect new crypto operations from being established in Ephrata, while the existing four businesses already there will continue operating.

Council member Kathleen Allstot clarified that the new ban implies taking a one-year “break” in order to see “see what’s going” in the sphere, as well as to find out how mining fits both in Ephrata and the Grant County Public Utility District (PUD).

Crypto mining operations have become increasingly popular in the cities of the Columbia Basin due to the region’s cheap electricity sources.

However, the growth of crypto mining developments in Ephrata has created some inconveniences for the residents, with some reportedly suffering a lack of electricity due to the operation of the high energy-consuming cooling equipment by the local crypto miners.

Ephrata’s recent move goes in line with crypto mining-related regulations imposed by a number of cities in the Grant County PUD, the article notes.

In late July 2018, Franklin PUD commissioners approved a moratorium that will provide staff with extra time to investigate the impact of mining on the electrical system before accepting applications for electricity from crypto mining companies in rural Washington.
