# Fundstrat Co-Founder Tom Lee: US Fed Rate Cuts Are Helping Bitcoin ...

###### 2019-07-31 19:07

Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder Tom Lee believes that recent interest rate cuts in the United States by the Federal Reserve are a boon for Bitcoin (BTC).

Lee remarked on how the rate cuts positively impact Bitcoin investment in an interview with Fox Business on July 31, saying:

“Bitcoin’s becoming increasingly a macrohedge for investors against things that could go wrong.

Liquidity is pushing money into all these risk assets and also hedges, which is helping Bitcoin.”

Lee delivered a couple more general remarks about Bitcoin, which climbed back above the $10,000 mark earlier today.

Lee also commented briefly on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s stated concerns about Facebook’s proposed Libra stablecoin.

Lee told Fox that he does not think those worries are applicable to Bitcoin:

“Libra is quite different in its architecture from Bitcoin, so I think that some of his comments are fair about Libra, but they don’t actually apply to Bitcoin.”

## Bitcoin as a hedge investment

Similar to Tom Lee’s remarks about Bitcoin being increasingly a macrohedge investment, the CEO of VC firm Social Capital, Chamath Palihapitiya, recently went so far as to call it the single best hedge against the traditional financial system.
