Switzerland-based crypto exchange ShapeShift announced the launch of a six-episode show, dubbed “Down the Rabbit Hole,” which is dedicated to crypto enthusiasts.

Company’s official Twitter account, @ShapeShift\_io, has posted six previews with a brief summary of each episode.

Rodgers shares her stance on the use of cryptocurrencies for the unbanked, along with funding social projects with crypto.

The third episode, “The Innovator,” is about Diego Gutiérrez Zaldívar, CEO of RSKLabs — an open-source smart contract platform that claims to create decentralized apps to empower people and improve their life quality.

The last episode is dedicated to Erik Voorhees, who founded Shapeshift back in 2013.

According to a recent tweet by Voorhees, the new video series is part of Shapeshift’s plan to rebrand and reimagine its services in 2019 shortly after it laid off a third of its team due to crashing prices and the ensuing Crypto Winter.

According to Voorhees, the firm is developing a non-custodial crypto platform in an easy package.
