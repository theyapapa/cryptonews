# Untraceable Payments and Unlinkable Transactions: Startup Offers “New Generation” Coin ...

Its ecosystem includes three separate but interchangeable blockchain payment methods, together with its own crypto bank, cloud mining platform and multi-currency exchange.

## Secure and private

The first blockchain payment method is PyrexCoin (PYX), operated by a decentralized peer-to-peer (p2p) exchange network with no management or major issuer to rule it.

Golden Pyrex (GPYX) is an ERC-20 utility token for paying for such services as PyrexBank fees, Marketplace products, PyrexExchange fees and Cloud Mining contracts at a discount rate.

## Cyberbank as a funding mechanism

PyrexBank, the “next generation private digital bank” developed on scalable Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) technology, offers traditional banking services and technological tools for managing crypto funds.

The clients of PyrexBank can also use its services, which include trading and liquidity management for fiat currency and crypto assets, together with a “highly secure storage” system for those assets.

PYREX is available here

The third payment method and a medium for all operations within PyrexBank is a special coin — also named PyrexBank Token (PXB) — which is a security token based on DAG technology and backed by physical gold.

## Cloud mining contracts and exchange

The company says all three “digital assets” provided by the project will be interchangeable at the core of the ecosystem — PyrexExchange, the cryptocurrency trading platform.
