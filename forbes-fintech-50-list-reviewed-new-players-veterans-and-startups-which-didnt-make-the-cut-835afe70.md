# Forbes “Fintech 50” List, Reviewed: New Players, Veterans and Startups Which Didn’t Make the Cut ...

Notably, there are just six crypto and blockchain companies featured this year, while the 2018 list contained 11 players from the field.

Nevertheless, while there is considerably fewer crypto companies featured this year, less than half of them — Ripple, BitFury, Coinbase — have made the list before, which means that new blood arrived regardless of the market condition.

This year, the magazine described the Amsterdam-based startup as a “full-service blockchain firm.”

Moreover, the company listed its first stablecoin in collaboration with Circle, another Forbes-listed crypto startup and announced plans to expand to the Japanese market.

Enterprise-focused, New York-based blockchain startup Axoni is perhaps the least recognized newcomer on the crypto part of the Forbes list.

This time, for instance, the company Blockchain, which was described as “the world’s most popular cryptocurrency wallet” by Forbes last year, didn’t make the cut.

Robinhood, a stock trading app that launched zero-fee crypto trading of BTC and ETH for its users in 2018, is featured on the fresh “Fintech 50” list for the second year in a row, although not in the “Crypto and Blockchain” section.
