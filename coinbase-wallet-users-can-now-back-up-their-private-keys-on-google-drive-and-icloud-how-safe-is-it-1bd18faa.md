On Feb. 12, San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase announced that users of its Coinbase Wallet can now back up their private keys on cloud storage, namely on Google Drive and iCloud.

With Coinbase Wallet, in turn, users store their own crypto protected by their unique private keys.

Thus, at the time, Coinbase Wallet supported ETH and ERC-20 tokens management, airdrops, crypto collectibles trading and storage, as well as access to DApps and decentralized exchanges, among others things.

## More about the new feature: support for Google Drive and iCloud, more cloud storage providers in the feature

Thus, on Feb. 12, Coinbase Wallet declared that its users can now back up their private keys on Google Drive and iCloud.

In the accompanying statement, Coinbase explained that allowing users to upload their keys to a cloud provides a safeguard against lost keys and will help them avoid losing funds should the keys be misplaced:

“The private keys generated and stored on your mobile device are the only way to access your funds on the blockchain.

Coinbase notes that neither they nor the cloud services will have access to user funds, as the recovery phrase key is unlocked by a password known only to the user.

Josh Datko and Thomas Roth, members of a team of security researchers who study hardware and software vulnerabilities under the title “Wallet.fail,” also told Cointelegraph that the new feature is safe enough, given that certain precautions are made:

“In our opinion, an user encrypted cloud backup does not significantly increase the risk of compromised given that the password is complex enough, the key derivation from the password to the AES-256-GCM key is sufficient, and there are no implementation mistakes.”
