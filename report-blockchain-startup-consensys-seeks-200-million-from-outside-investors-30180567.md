# Report: Blockchain Startup ConsenSys Seeks $200 Million From Outside Investors ...

New York-based blockchain company ConsenSys is reportedly seeking investors to raise $200 million, technology media outlet The Information reported on April 15.

The company’s executives reportedly talked to investors in Hong Kong and South Korea, however as of early April ConsenSys had purportedly not yet found a lead investor.

The Information cited fundraising documents, revealing that ConsenSys closed 2018 with just $21 million in revenue coming mostly from its enterprise consulting business.

The documents reportedly reveal that ConsenSys has a considerable share in blockchain companies that it has incubated.

ConsenSys has reportedly been seeking a valuation of at least $1 billion, which The Information reports is too high, given the company’s revenue and investors.

Last December, anonymous sources stated that ConsenSys could lay off up to 60 percent of its staff as the blockchain space had become more competitive and “crowded.”

Later in January, ConsenSys’ Executive Director of Enterprise and Social Impact Vanessa Grellet told Cointelegraph that the layoffs did not exceed 13% of staff.
