Bitcoin (BTC) automated teller machine (ATM) manufacturer Lamassu has moved to Switzerland due to regulatory difficulties in other countries, according to a blog post published Jan. 1.

Lamassu revealed in the post that its applications to open an account were rejected by 15 banks because it produces terminals for Bitcoin, while not taking part in trading or storing digital currencies.

Switzerland is known for its crypto-friendly approach and blockchain development hub “Crypto Valley” in the city of Zug.

In May, the formerly largest cryptocurrency exchange in Poland, BitBay, decided to suspend its activities in the country as banks would no longer cooperate with the company.

Later in June, the world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance, set up a bank account in Malta, saying that the new bank account was a “very significant” development since the exchange first revealed it was relocating its headquarters to the island.

Apart from Switzerland and Malta, other countries — such as Bermuda, Estonia and Liechtenstein — are also actively adjusting and creating legislation to welcome blockchain and crypto projects.

In July, Bermuda put forward plans to amend the Banking Act in order to establish a new class of banks that offers services to local fintech and blockchain organizations.
