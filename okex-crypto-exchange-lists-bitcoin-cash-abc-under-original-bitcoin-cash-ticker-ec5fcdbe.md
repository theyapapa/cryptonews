The Malta-based cryptocurrency exchange OKEx announced that it will list Bitcoin Cash ABC under the original Bitcoin Cash ticker BCH, according to an official statement Dec. 11.

According to the announcement, the sixth largest crypto exchange will change the ticker of Bitcoin Cash ABC from BCHABC to BCH.

Bitcoin Cash ABC has earned the BCH ticker on other major exchanges as well.

On Dec. 8, the Gemini crypto exchange founded by the Winklevoss brothers announced that it will “only be providing support for the Bitcoin ABC network,” which it states will be identified on the platform as “Bitcoin Cash with ticker: BCH.”

Bitcoin Cash split into Bitcoin Cash ABC (Adjustable Blocksize Cap) and Bitcoin Cash SV (Satoshi’s Vision) in a hard fork that was the result of a network update on Nov. 15.

Since the split, Bitcoin Cash ABC — championed by crypto evangelist Roger Ver — appears to have claimed victory.

It further alleged that on Nov. 20, the Bitcoin Cash ABC dev team put a “poison pill” into the blockchain by way of a “Deep Reorg Prevention” in order to strengthen control over the Bitcoin Cash blockchain ledger.
