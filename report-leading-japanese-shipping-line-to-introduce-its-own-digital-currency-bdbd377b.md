Japanese shipping company Nippon Yusen K.K. (NYK) is reportedly launching its own digital currency for crew members, Bloomberg reported Nov. 20.

People familiar with the matter reportedly told Bloomberg that NYK is introducing its own digital currency for crew members in order to simplify the process of managing, sending, and converting money into marine workers’ local currencies.

According to Bloomberg, it is not clear whether NYK’s digital currency will use blockchain technology or be a form of cryptocurrency.

Per the anonymous sources, NYK is working with banks and software development companies to ensure the currency’s ability to be converted into local currencies.

NYK will supposedly introduce the digital currency in the first half of 2019, while the initiative presupposes the use of smartphones.

Along with paying their own workers, the company is also looking to offer the currency to other shipping operators.

Earlier this month, nine major terminal operators and shipping companies signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to launch an open digital platform based on distributed ledger technology (DLT).
