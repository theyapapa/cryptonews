# Price Analysis 26/08: BTC, ETH, XRP, BCH, LTC, BNB, EOS, BSV, XMR, XLM ...

###### 2019-08-26 15:08

Due to this uncertainty on the chart and price below both moving averages, we are not recommending traders to go long at current levels.

If bulls can push the price above the 20-day EMA, it will signal the end of the downtrend.

## BCH/USD

The volatility in Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has shrunk and the price is stuck between the trendline of the channel and the 20-day EMA.

If bulls can push the price above the 20-day EMA, it might attract traders in anticipation of a change in trend.

Above the 20-day EMA, there is a minor resistance at the 50-day SMA, above which the EOS/USD pair can move up to $4.8719.

Aggressive traders can buy on a close (UTC time) above the 20-day EMA and keep a stop loss of $3.20.

The bulls attempted to push the price above the 20-day EMA and the horizontal resistance of $0.072545 on Aug. 25, but failed.
