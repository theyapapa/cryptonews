###### 2019-02-20 15:02

Institutional-grade cryptocurrency investment services firm BitGo will provide wallet and custody support for cryptocurrency Tron (TRX), according to a press release shared with Cointelegraph on Feb. 20.

Per the release, BitGo will add support for TRX later this year, making it available for institutional investors.

TRX thus joins over 100 other digital currencies already supported by BitGo.

BitGo is reportedly the world’s largest processor of on-chain Bitcoin (BTC) transactions, processing 15 percent of all global Bitcoin transactions and $15 billion of cryptocurrencies per month.

Yesterday, BitGo revealed plans to offer crypto insurance for digital assets held on its Business Wallet service and custodial offering through Lloyd's of London.

In January, BitGo partnered with Bitcoin over-the-counter (OTC) trading platform Genesis Global Trading to allow clients trading cryptocurrency directly from BitGo custody.

The partnership allows BitGo custody clients to execute internal settlements on the same day, powered by Genesis’ high liquidity based on a large network of trading partners.
