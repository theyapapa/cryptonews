# Top 5 Crypto Performers Overview: BCH, LTC, DASH, NEO, XEM ...

###### 2019-04-06 13:04

Many altcoins outperformed Bitcoin, which shows that the market participants are accumulating the select beaten down cryptocurrencies at low prices.

## BCH/USD

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) turned out to be the best performer among the major cryptocurrencies in the past seven days.

This increases the probability of a minor consolidation or correction for the next couple of weeks as the bears try to reverse direction and sink the price back below $200 levels.

## LTC/USD

Even before the crypto rally began across the board, Litecoin (LTC) had increased about 101.22 percent in the first quarter, which shows that the traders had been gradually accumulating the cryptocurrency.

Latin American cryptocurrency exchange Daexs has added Dash, which will help investors buy the digital currency in the Colombian peso.

After trading in a tight range of $56.214 to $103.261 for 16 weeks, the DASH/USD pair broke out and closed (UTC time frame) above the range in the previous week.

But if the digital currency can rally and sustain above $0.07790717, it will indicate that the markets have rejected the lower levels and a rise to the top of the range at $0.13125258 is probable.
