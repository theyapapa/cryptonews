Blockchain consensus algorithm and peer-to-peer (P2P) networking protocol Tendermint has raised $9 million in a Series A investment round, according to a blog post published on March 14.

Tendermint has raised $9 million in the Series A investment round led by cryptocurrency investment company Paradigm, with contribution from Bain Capital and 1confirmation among other investors.

The round closing follows the Cosmos Hub mainnet launch — so called “The Internet of Blockchains,” developed by Tendermint — on March 13.

The developers believe that Cosmos may contribute to solving blockchain’s scalability and interoperability problems.

In this future, interoperability solutions provide a crucial alchemy that could lead to an explosion of blockchain applications, as well as boosting usage on existing chains.”

Cosmos Hub will further pass two more phases, as the recent launch was reportedly the first in a series of proof-of-stake chains developed by Tendermint.

Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao reportedly said that Binance Chain is based on the Tendermint protocol and runs on a Delegated-Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus algorithm.
