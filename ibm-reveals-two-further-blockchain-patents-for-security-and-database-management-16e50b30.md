# IBM Reveals Two Further Blockchain Patents for Security And Database Management ...

Multinational computing giant IBM is adding to its stack of blockchain patents with two new applications, the United States Patent and Trademark Office confirmed, publishing documents on March 5.

According to one patent document, IBM now seeks to target network security using blockchain technology.

“Securing a data log using monitor security protocols may be accomplished with different levels of security, ranging from low security to high security, and have various combinations of hardware and software configurations,” the description of the first blockchain patent explains:

“Low security may allow open access to the event logs while high security may significantly restrict access to the event logs.

For the second patent, IBM says so-called database management systems (DBMSs) are currently inefficient due to their bulk and could therefore benefit from the streamlining blockchain solutions tend to offer.

“DBMSs are typically configured to separate the process of storing data from accessing, manipulating, or using data stored in a database,” the patent document summarizes, continuing:

“DBMSs often require tremendous resources to handle the heavy workloads placed on such systems.

As Cointelegraph reported, IBM has rolled out various enterprise blockchain offers over the past several years, principally under its IBM Blockchain project.

This week also saw IBM unveil its security testing tool aimed at identifying weak links in enterprise blockchain deployments.
