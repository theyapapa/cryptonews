## BTC/USD

Bitcoin has been trading near the neckline for the past two days.

## XRP/USD

Ripple has been trading in a tight range for the past few days.

## BCH/USD

After a strong run from the lows, Bitcoin Cash has been consolidating in a tight range for the past few days.

A break out of the range can resume the recovery and propel the BCH/USD pair to the next target of $307.01, with a minor resistance at $239.

If the TRX/USD pair turns down from the current levels, it is likely to remain range bound for a few more days.

## BSV/USD

The range in Bitcoin SV has shrunk in the past few days.
