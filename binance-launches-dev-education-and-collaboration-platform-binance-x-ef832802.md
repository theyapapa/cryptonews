Major global crypto exchange Binance has introduced its new developer-focused project, called Binance X.

## Bringing devs to relevant Binance programs

The exchange launched Binance X on Aug. 29, aiming to provide blockchain developers with all necessary resources to drive new solutions on Binance’s projects, as well as in the whole blockchain ecosystem, according to a press release shared with Cointelegraph.

Binance X platform will reportedly support developers and their initiatives by assisting in education and collaboration on Binance and connecting them with relevant internal programs that help projects progress at different stages of growth.

The programs include Binance Labs Incubation, Binance Launchpad, company’s strategic investment arm, M&A, as well as Binance X Fellowship, a program with over 40 projects supported by major developers and researchers, including Hammad Tariq of GoBNB.

Specifically, the new platform will allow developers to create new solutions within a number of Binance’s products, including the Binance Chain, Binance.com APIs, Trust Wallet SDKs and Binance Charity donation platform, the press release notes.

According to the announcement, developers will now be able to find links to all of the official developer resources from each product on Binance.

Additionally, Binance X’s so-called Evangelist Program recruits volunteers to carry out local and college meetups, reading groups, workshops and hackathons, the report notes.

Yesterday, Cointelegraph reported that Binance futures trading platform will launch in September.
