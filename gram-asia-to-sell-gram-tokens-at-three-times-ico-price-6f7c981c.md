South Korea’s Gram Asia is selling rights to its Gram holdings at $4.00 per token starting July 10, according to a report by Bloomberg on July 3

The proposed sale price is triple the original $1.33 sale price at Gram’s second initial coin offering (ICO) round in March 2018.

Liquid also hosted the Gram ICO in March, at which time Telegram raised $850 million, bringing its total valuation up to $1.7 billion.

Citing an email from the exchange, Bloomberg reports that users who buy Gram with the exchange’s native token, QASH, will get a $0.50 discount per token.

Gram is the yet-to-be-released native token for the Telegram Open Network (TON), a decentralized network project by the open source, encrypted messenger app Telegram.

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Gram Asia is the largest holder of the Gram token in Asia.

Additionally, the exchange Liquid apparently has a deal with Gram Asia, but not Telegram.

Liquid CEO Mike Kayamori pointed to the 200 million people using Telegram as providing an attractive platform for decentralized app developers:

“If you are a distributed app vendor, would you want to be listed on top of Ethereum?
