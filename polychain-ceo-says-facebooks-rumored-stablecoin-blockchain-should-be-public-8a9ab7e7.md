# Polychain CEO Says Facebook’s Rumored Stablecoin Blockchain Should Be Public ...

Polychain Capital CEO Olaf Carlson-Wee thinks Facebook would be smart to build its stablecoin on a public, open blockchain infrastructure.

Carlson-Wee explained that the blockchain platform he is referring to is one like bitcoin’s, in which the creator relinquishes control over the platform they built.

He argues that such an arrangement would be beneficial to the social media giant, saying:

“I think given all the problems that Facebook has had with policing their platform and things like that, I think that the strategic move for Facebook would actually be to build public infrastructure.

And that public infrastructure could be incorporated onto all the Facebook platforms, which of course are proprietary.

But that public infrastructure, if they don’t try to own it, I think that’s where they will have the most success.”

He stated:

“If big technology companies want to put their resources toward building public peer-to-peer crypto infrastructure, I would be ecstatic.”

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, an anonymous source told Bloomberg that Facebook will roll out its cryptocurrency, purportedly a stablecoin, some time in the third quarter of 2019.
