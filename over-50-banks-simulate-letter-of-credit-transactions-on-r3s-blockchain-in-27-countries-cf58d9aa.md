Over 50 banks participated in the simulation of letter of credit transactions on R3’s blockchain platform in 27 countries on six continents.

Per the release, 96% of the participants said that the system — dubbed Voltron — will accelerate and reduce the cost of their letters of credits procedure.

Furthermore, 86% of them reportedly believe the inefficiencies of the traditional system are becoming intolerable.

The company claims that Voltron cuts the execution time of the procedure from 5-10 days to under 24 hours.

R3 states that, as a result of the adoption of the new system, 61% said that they are likely to move trade flows to “open account,” an option which is reportedly riskier for exporters.

The system was delivered through a partnership of Bain, CryptoBLK and R3 on Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform.

As Cointelegraph reported in March, United Kingdom-based banking giant HSBC is seeking banking partners in South Korea to deploy Voltron in the country.
