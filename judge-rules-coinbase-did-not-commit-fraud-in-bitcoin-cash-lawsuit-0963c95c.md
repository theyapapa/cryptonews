Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase did not act fraudulently during its botched launch of Bitcoin Cash (BCH), a United States judge has ruled.

## Coinbase accused of insider trading BCH listing

In a court order issued on Aug. 6, U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria of the Northern District of California (San Francisco) threw out claims by traders that Coinbase committed fraud by halting trading after two minutes.

Following the debacle, Coinbase was widely accused of insider trading, with executives allegedly manipulating markets by buying up BCH based on prior knowledge of the plans.

He continued:

“Even assuming Bitcoin Cash is a commodity subject to the Commodities Exchange Act, the complaint does not sufficiently explain how the launch manipulated the market for Bitcoin Cash or for Bitcoin.

## Motion to dismiss the fraud claims is granted

Plaintiffs will now have to move forward based on a negligence lawsuit.

The BCH launch, Chhabria claimed, was enacted too quickly, engendering problems from the outset.

The document also absolves Coinbase’s CEO, Brian Armstrong, and head of product, David Farmer, from fraud:

“Moreover, while the factual allegations paint a compelling picture of an incompetent launch by Coinbase, the complaint does not outline a coherent account of fraud by Coinbase, Armstrong, and Farmer.”
