Senior analyst at market strategy and sector research company Fundstrat Global Advisors Tom Lee is confident that Bitcoin (BTC) became a genuine safe haven for investors.

When asked directly “whether Bitcoin is a genuine safe haven” during an interview on the Fox Business channel on Aug. 15, Lee confirmed his position:

“Yes.

## Bitcoin is a good diversification hedge

Lee also added that Bitcoin has “done very well this year,” reminding the audience that last December its price hovered around $3,000, and since then rose to the $10,000–12,000 levels.

The Fundstrat analyst also noted that Bitcoin is “really uncorrelated to equities, to bonds, so it’s a good diversification hedge.”

According to Lee, currently Bitcoin “is just resting”, and can show a significant rise in its price by the end of 2019.

I think anyone who wants to have a 2% or 1% allocation to Bitcoin as a hedge against a lot of things that could go wrong — it’s a smart bet.”

## Crypto community hopes for the better
