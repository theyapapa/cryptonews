# Electrum Faces Another Fake Wallet Attack, Users Reported to Lose Millions of Dollars ...

Bitcoin (BTC) wallet service Electrum is facing an ongoing Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack on its servers, the company reported on Twitter on April 7.

The ongoing DoS attack was allegedly launched by a malicious botnet of more than 140,000 machines, and aims to steal users’ Bitcoin by referring them to fake versions of Electrum software.

According to The Next Web, the attackers have even implemented their own Electrum servers hosting compromised Electrum versions in order to realize the hack.

After users sync their vulnerable Electrum wallet with a malicious server, they are directed to “update” their client with a hacked version, which eventually leads to an immediate loss of funds that were contained in the old versions, the report explains.

Accordingly, Electrum’s website says that the software versions older than 3.3 can no longer connect to public servers and must be upgraded, which is a measure to prevent user exposure to phishing messages.

In the recent announcement on Twitter, Electrum recommended its users to disable the auto-connect option and select their server manually, while the company is working on a more robust version of the Electrum server in order to fix the issue.

Recently, online video distribution giant YouTube was reported to erroneously run a malicious advertisement for Electrum wallet, which again contained a malware version of the software.
