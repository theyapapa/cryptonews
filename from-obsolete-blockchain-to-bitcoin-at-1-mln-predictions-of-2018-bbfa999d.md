## Predictions that went wrong

Tom Lee: BTC will reach $25K

Seems that one of the world’s major crypto bulls, co-founder and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors Tom Lee, has had some bad luck predicting possible BTC rates.

“Definitely possible could be 20 years from now or it could be tomorrow.
