San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange and wallet service Coinbase is finishing negotiations that would value the company at $8 billion, technology news site Recode reports Oct. 2.

Citing anonymous sources familiar with the matter, Recode states that Coinbase is in talks with Tiger Global and its shareholders regarding a possible $500 million investment.

CNBC quotes Novogratz at the Economist's Finance Disrupted conference on Tuesday:

“Here's the poster child (Coinbase) of the crypto space worth $8 billion — that's a real company, and Tiger's not a flake of an investor.

According to CNBC, a deal with Tiger Global would make Coinbase one of the most highly valued startups in the U.S.

Recently, Coinbase introduced a new product called “Coinbase Bundle,” which it purports will simplify the crypto trading process.

Coinbase Bundles is a basket of five cryptocurrencies supported on Coinbase — Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and Ethereum Classic (ETC) — and purchased in proportion to their market capitalization in U.S. dollars.

Today, Coinbase announced that Chris Dodds, a member of the board at Charles Schwab, would be joining the exchange’s board to contribute to the Coinbase’s expansion in terms of its financial services capabilities.
