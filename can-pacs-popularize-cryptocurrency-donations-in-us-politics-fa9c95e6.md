# Can PACs Popularize Cryptocurrency Donations in US Politics? ...

Super PACs, on the other hand, cannot make any direct contributions, but can spend unlimited amounts of funds in support of their candidates independent of their campaigns — and can pool donations of any size.

## Dan Backer and his BitPAC, a crypto-centered hybrid committee with plans for an ICO

Dan Backer, the founding attorney of political.law, a campaign finance and political law firm, who successfully argued the aforementioned Carey v. FEC case in 2011, boldly called himself “the father of the Hybrid PAC” in a conversation with Cointelegraph.

In an email sent to Cointelegraph, he wrote:

“BitPAC is a hybrid PAC, so it may accept and disburse candidate contributable dollars to candidates, and accept unlimited contributions for non-candidate contribution purposes.

I should know, I’m the father of the Hybrid PAC”

Soon upon establishing, BitPAC sent paper wallets containing BTC to several candidates, bipartisan and bicameral, to see how they would report those donations to the FEC.

Backer explained the mission behind the new token to Cointelegraph:

“The purpose is to facilitate the normalization of crypto-contributions in the political giving landscape, both to donors who are interested in that and candidates and their consultants/vendors who generally are agnostic to money as long as they get it.

## The pitfalls of accepting crypto-based donations in U.S. politics

Accepting cryptocurrencies as political donations is not a common practice in the U.S. — although committees can legally receive Bitcoin as a contribution, as the FEC ruled in 2014.

Another 2020 presidential candidate who was accepting cryptocurrency donations, Eric Swalwell, dropped out of the race in July, just two months after announcing a crypto donations campaign.
