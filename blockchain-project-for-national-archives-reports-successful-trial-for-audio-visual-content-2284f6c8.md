A blockchain project developed to safeguard the integrity and accessibility of digital government records of national archives worldwide will soon present the results of a successful trial deployment in the United Kingdom, Estonia and Norway.

The project, named ARCHANGEL, involves the U.K. National Archives, the University of Surrey and the U.K. Open Data Institute, with funding from the The Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC).

Its trial deployment in the U.K., Estonia and Norway focused on leveraging blockchain and other technologies to tackle the long-term future of digital video archives.

In a statement for the press release, University of Surrey professor John Collomosse and ARCHANGEL principal investigator said that it is becoming increasingly critical that institutions are able to vouchsafe the provenance and integrity of archival materials to the public in a transparent manner, considering the vast volume of digital content accumulating in archives worldwide.

The press release notes that ARCHANGEL forms part of the Surrey blockchain testbed, which reportedly includes over £3.5 million ($4.4 million) of UKRI (UK Research and Innovation) and EU funded projects.

Professor Adrian Hilton, director of CVSSP, noted in his statement that the ambitious project represents a “great opportunity for the UK to lead internationally in application of distributed ledger technology to secure personal and national data archives."

The press release further includes the national government archives of the United States and Australia as two places where the ARCHANGEL project has been trialled thus far.
