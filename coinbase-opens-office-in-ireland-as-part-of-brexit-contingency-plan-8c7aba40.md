San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has opened a new office in Dublin, Ireland, according to an announcement published Oct. 15.

In addition to helping expand its operations in Europe, the new Irish offices are reportedly part of a contingency plan for when the U.K. leaves the E.U.

Per the announcement, the Dublin team will take on a number of new business-related functions, while London will remain Coinbase’s main office in Europe.

Coinbase’s U.K. CEO Zeeshan Feroz told the Guardian that the company is looking to capitalize on the talent pool available in Ireland.

Feroz further added that the Irish office would enable Coinbase to serve its customers in the E.U. should the U.K. leave:

“It is also a plan B for Brexit.

As previously reported, in the case of an eventual Brexit, the U.K. and the E.U. agreed to leave the border between the Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland open.

British finance minister Philip Hammond expressed hope that blockchain technology could help ensure seamless post-Brexit trade between the U.K. and the E.U., as it enables product movement to be recorded transparently and without changes.

In May, academics at the National University of Ireland Galway urged the government to promote blockchain in the country, arguing that the technology’s potential impact on economic growth could transform business and government operations.
