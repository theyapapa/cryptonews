###### 2019-07-01 01:07

One of the most prominent crypto cybercrimes in recent years took a dramatic turn on June 23, when two Israeli brothers were arrested in connection with the 2016 Bitfinex hack and other crypto-related phishing attacks.

Hartej Sawhney, co-founder of Zokyo Labs, a digital product and cybersecurity agency and co-founder of Las Vegas-based smart contract auditing firm Hosho, told Cointelegraph via email that military training would not be necessary for cybercrime in the current environment:

“You don't need ‘military training’ to conduct cybercrime on today’s centralized exchanges.

Igor Kotsiuba, a researcher and cybersecurity expert at Cyberdesk, told Cointelegraph that certain hacks could theoretically be carried out with information obtained in school:

“The most prevalent attacks in the crypto world today are DDoS and phishing.

Sawhney also commented on techniques popular among hackers at the moment, many of which are also about stealing user data:

“‘Clipboard hijackers’ are becoming common on wallets and exchanges, operating in the clipboard and replacing copied wallet data with one of the hackers in the midst of transferring Bitcoin.

Although hacks are common in the crypto world, their activities naturally bring on repercussions from law authorities.

Although tracking down cyber criminals is one thing, Sawhney believes that taskforces and companies alike need to get into the hacker’s mindset to prevent cyber attacks from happening altogether: “In order to fight cybercrime and maximize cyberdefense, taskforces and companies need to learn to approach things from a hacker perspective, not an information security perspective.

## Origins of the hack 

When Bitfinex first announced the hack in August 2016, it was the largest dollar-based exchange for Bitcoin in the world, and the $72 million theft was the second-biggest security compromise in the history of cryptocurrency.
