# Qtum Awards $400K Grant to Columbia University Research Team for Smart Contracts R&D ...

Open source blockchain project Qtum has awarded a $400,000 grant to academics at Columbia University to fund the development of a new programming language for Ethereum (ETH)-style smart contracts.

The R&D will reportedly focus on the design and implementation of a new language named “DeepSEA” and its integration with Ethereum-style smart contracts.

An earlier outline of DeepSEA states that the language can “tackle \[an\] inherent conflict” in programming, namely that:

“\[T\]oday's mainstream operating systems and hypervisors are still written in C-like low-level languages.

The researchers’ aims are to continue to both design and implement the language, and to develop a DeepSEA “toolchain,” which could subsequently be applied to “build certified OS kernels and Ethereum-style smart contracts.”

According to his faculty profile, Professor Gu’s work beyond Columbia includes the co-founding of blockchain startup “CertiK,” which the Qtum Foundation has reportedly invested in.

An overview of CertiK states the project is a “formal verification framework that aims to mathematically prove that smart contracts and blockchain ecosystems are bug-free and hacker-resistant.”

As previously reported, the Singapore-registered Qtum Foundation developed Qtum as an open source hybrid blockchain application platform, with a particular focus on smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps).
