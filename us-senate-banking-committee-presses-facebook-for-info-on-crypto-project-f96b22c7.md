The Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the United States Senate is seeking information on Facebook’s reported cryptocurrency project.

The committee addressed its concerns to Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a letter on May 9.

The committee also asks Zuckerberg whether Facebook shares or sells consumer information with unaffiliated third parties.

Canadian legislators have also called on Zuckerberg to testify, after it was found that Facebook violated the country’s privacy laws.

The committee further asks whether Facebook has any information on individuals’ credit standing, credit capacity, creditworthiness or information that could affect their ability to secure credit.

In February, the New York Times reported that the token would be usable on multiple platforms, including Facebook itself and Instagram.

Facebook is reportedly seeking $1 billion in investments for the token project from major payment networks Visa and MasterCard.
