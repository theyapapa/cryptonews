Speaking to Cointelegraph at Blockchain Week Rome, Teck Chei, partner at Binance Labs, said that he sees Facebook’s Libra Project at a step forward for crypto and increasing public awareness.

In Chei’s own words:

“I think having a company like Facebook, with such tremendous reach and distribution, into all different countries around the world – having them be interested in cryptocurrency and launching one is a very very positive thing for our industry.

Regarding concerns over Facebook’s use of crypto representing a step towards centralization, Chei remarked that they are one of 100 founders of Project Libra.

Binance and Facebook will be able to work together, Chei predicted:

“We naturally will engage with Facebook to kind of see how we can help advance the industry together.”

Facebook’s Libra project has been subject to no small amount of criticism, both from governments suspicious of Facebook’s data use and from die-hard crypto followers concerned about centralization.

In the United States, Libra will be the subject of Congressional hearings in July over concerns that Libra cryptocurrency will pose a threat to security.

Chei’s commentary comes on the heels of Gin Chao’s statement that Binance was engaged in official discussions with Facebook, as Cointelegraph reported on June 28.
