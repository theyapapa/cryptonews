Chinese telecommunications hardware giant Huawei is studying the entire Latin American market and considering expanding its operations, Cointelegraph Brazil reports on June 13.

Per the report, a Huawei executive said at the CIAB Febraban conference on June 11 that it is possible its blockchain-enabled products and services will soon be available on the continent.

The executive in question — who asked to remain anonymous — noted:

“Everything will depend on the outcome of our market analysis and in case there is a market demand for blockchain we will make our services available in this area.

In April last year, Huawei also launched its blockchain-as-a-service offering through its cloud platform, which reportedly allows the creation and management of blockchain applications at low cost.

When asked about the United States–China trade war and the possible effects on the company, the executive declared that he is confident that it will be resolved and noted that the only problem that needs solving is access to Google’s Android software licensing.

As Cointelegraph reported earlier today, blockchain software consortium R3 revealed that it is developing a blockchain platform in Brazil with banks Bradesco, Itau and B3.

Yesterday news broke that CIP, a facilitator of Brazilian banking and financial infrastructure, has officially launched its blockchain ID platform via a partnership with IBM using Hyperledger Fabric.
