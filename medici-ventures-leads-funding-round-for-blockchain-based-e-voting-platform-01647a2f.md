Medici Ventures, the blockchain-based subsidiary of Overstock.com, has led a $7 million funding round for a blockchain-based voting platform, according to a press release on June 6.

The blockchain-based voting platform, Voatz, is reportedly designed to allow citizens to participate in official elections and similar events via mobile devices, such as smartphones or tablet computers.

Voatz says that the proceeds of their $7 million Series A funding round will go toward improving accessibility and usability of the platform, as well as launching additional pilot programs in the United States and abroad.

Voatz also commented that they have previously conducted pilot programs with a variety of organizations, such as state political parties, universities, labor unions, church groups and nonprofits.

Voatz has reportedly completed a pilot program in which military personnel and U.S. citizens living abroad voted on the platform in Denver, Colorado’s 2019 municipal elections.

Voatz also broke ground with a pilot in which similarly out-of-country citizens and military personnel from West Virginia used the platform to submit absentee votes in the 2018 midterm elections.

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Russia’s ruling political party United Russia launched a blockchain-based voting platform last month.
