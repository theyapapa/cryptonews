Exchange hacks are an unfortunate yet predictable occurrence in cryptocurrency and add to its notoriety as a “Wild West” marketplace.

The hack of New Zealand exchange platform Cryptopia was reported in January after several days of on-and-off maintenance, when it finally announced on Jan. 15 that, at the time, around $16 million had been stolen from over 76,000 different wallet addresses.

According to Hacken’s blockchain security team, “The Cryptopia hack is quite different from other exchange and wallet hacks.

Blockchain forensics firm Elementus said at the time, “Despite the hack, many Cryptopia users continue depositing funds into their ethereum wallets.

The recent Binance hack to the tune of $40 million was also catalyzed by error, but these instances could also be preventable if exchanges didn’t insist on being responsible for keeping customer funds safe.
