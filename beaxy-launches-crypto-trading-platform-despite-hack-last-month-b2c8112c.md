Beaxy has announced the launch of its cryptocurrency trading platform on June 11 in a press release shared with Cointelegraph.

According to Beaxy, an exclusive partnership with OneMarketData delivers trading capabilities across nine order types, with transaction speeds of 225,000 per second per trading pair.

Separately, in May, Beaxy CEO Artak Hamazaspyan had uploaded a statement to Twitter confirming that the exchange had been hacked on May 22.

Despite the technical hiccups in May, Beaxy’s CEO, Artak Hamazaspyan, said:

“I couldn’t be happier with the product this incredible team has built.

Through prioritizing user experience, security, regulatory guidance and seamless functionality, I am confident we’ve built a best-in-class trading platform.”

On May 8, Binance — one of the largest crypto exchanges by trading volume — suffered a major security breach that enabled hackers to withdraw 7,000 bitcoins (BTC) worth $54.6 million at press time.

Last week, crypto wallet provider Komodo revealed it had effectively hacked itself to stop fraudsters stealing user funds worth $13 million.
