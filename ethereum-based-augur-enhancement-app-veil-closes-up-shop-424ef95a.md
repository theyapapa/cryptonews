# Ethereum-Based Augur Enhancement App Veil Closes Up Shop ...

###### 2019-07-12 19:07

The Ethereum-based predictions platform Veil is shutting down, according to an official Medium post on July 11.

Veil co-founder Paul Fletcher-Hill recommended that users redeem open positions, withdraw positions from active markets, and withdraw Veil Ether and convert it to Ether.

Veil was a type of extension to the Ethereum-based predictions market Augur.

Augur is a predictions market — that still exists — that uses smart contracts to let users create and bet on the outcome of any event with the cryptocurrency Ether.

For instance, the top three bets listed on the Augur market, at press time, are “Will Novak Djokovic be the 2019 Wimbledon Men's Singles winner?

According to its website, Veil was intended to “bring Augur mainstream” and improve user experience by speeding up its transaction processes.

Veil purportedly let users trade on the Augur marketplace faster via the 0x protocol, and provided instant settlement by allowing users to sell their shares to Veil before native finalization of Augur transactions on the blockchain.
