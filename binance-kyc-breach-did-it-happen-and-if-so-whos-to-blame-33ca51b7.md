# Binance KYC Breach — Did It Happen, and If So, Who’s to Blame? ...

###### 2019-08-10 10:08

On Aug. 7, Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange (by daily trade volume), fell victim to a hacking scandal that saw the miscreant allegedly gain possession of a huge chunk of the firm’s Know Your Customer (KYC) data (10,000+ personal photos).

On the subject, Binance’s security team had the following comment:

“At the present time, no evidence has been supplied that indicates any KYC images have been obtained from Binance, as these images do not contain the digital watermark imprinted by our system.”

Similarly, the exchange reportedly also asked the hacker to provide them with more information regarding the source of this KYC data, but the individual simply demanded 300 BTC and refused to give the team any irrefutable evidence.

In this regard, following this latest data breach, the price of Binance Coin (BNB) — the premier crypto exchange’s native digital currency — has soared by over 12%, thereby indicating that the global crypto community doesn't seem to care all that much about this possible security mishap.

Platon claims that the hacker(s) could gain access to all of this information by infiltrating the account of a company insider who allegedly installed a back door into Binance’s trading module (via API keys) — thereby allowing the hacker(s) to make off with the aforementioned sum of crypto.

Platon — who refers to himself as a “white hacker” — allegedly demanded a reward of 300 Bitcoins from Binance in return for providing the company with details of the intruders, including their names, phone numbers, photos, server data and correspondence.

But when representatives working for the exchange did not grant his request for a reward, he released the KYC details of more than 600 Binance customers via different Telegram groups.
