## BTC/USD

Bitcoin (BTC) has been struggling to rebound from the 20-day EMA for the past two days.

This points to a consolidation in the short-term until the bulls breakout of the resistance or the bears breakdown of the supports.

## LTC/USD

Litecoin (LTC) has been holding above the 20-day EMA for the past two days but has not been able to clear the overhead resistance at $47.2460.

## BCH/USD

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has been holding the support at the moving averages for the past two days.

A breakdown of the moving averages can attract selling that can plummet the price to $105 and if this level also fails to hold, the next support is way lower at $73.50.

## XLM/USD

Stellar (XLM) has been trading above the downtrend line for the past two days but the price has not rebounded strongly from the support.

## BNB/USD

The bulls are attempting to hold the 20-day EMA, while the bears are defending the $10â€“$12 zone.
