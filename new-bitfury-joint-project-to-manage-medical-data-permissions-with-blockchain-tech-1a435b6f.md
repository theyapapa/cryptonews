The Bitfury Group and blockchain-powered medical data marketplace Longenesis have jointly launched production of a blockchain-based consent management system for the healthcare industry.

Per the release, the new product addresses issues with the management of user consent for ongoing and upcoming research endeavors, compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), as well as streamlining data collection for medical research.

Once collected, all data and updates to user consent are reportedly recorded on the ExonumTM blockchain with timestamping for future auditing.

Alex Zhavoronkov, CEO of Insilico Medicine, Inc., said:

â€œWhile the regulations vary from country to country, the research organizations should strive to deploy content management systems that protect the data owners far better than any regulation.

In February, Bitfury partnered with radiology blockchain marketplace Medical Diagnostic Web (MDW) to create a blockchain-based medical imaging ecosystem.

Academics from the University of California, San Francisco, also proposed a method of sharing medical data using a blockchain-based system.

In addition, the system aims to advance methods for reporting adverse events during research and improve medical record management.
