Justin Sun, CEO of decentralized internet startup TRON, has hinted at a forthcoming partnership with an unknown firm valued at “tens of billions of dollars.”

The tweet, posted Friday, Oct. 12, gives little information, stating that:

“Finally, First time to partner with tens of billions USD valuation industry giant.

Not tens of billions.”

None of these have been confirmed as of press time.

This is the second time that the CEO’s tweets have made crypto headlines this month: on Oct. 8, Sun claimed the TRON token’s forthcoming update would see it beat Ethereum (ETH) on speed and EOS on cost, prompting an 8 percent surge in the asset’s value.

In late September, TRON released further details of its bid to integrate with torrent client BitTorrent, which it had acquired this July for an undisclosed amount.

As of press time, TRON’s TRX cryptocurrency is ranked 11th largest cryptocurrency by market cap and is trading at around $0.0227 per token, up 1.65 percent on the day.
