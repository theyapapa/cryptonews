On stage at the Consensus Invest event in New York, Sprecher was accompanied by his wife and the CEO of cryptocurrency platform Bakkt, Kelly Loeffler.

Commenting on the Bitcoin (BTC) futures contract offering, Loeffler said that “the Bakkt futures contract will help Bitcoin traders establish a trusted price.

ICE then planned to pull data from 15 major exchanges and deliver it to big financial names, including hedge funds and professional trading firms.

ICE reportedly “has had conversations with other financial institutions about setting up a new operation through which banks can buy a contract, known as a swap, that will end with the customer owning Bitcoin the next day — with the backing and security of the exchange.”

Among ADAM’s founding members are former CEO of the NYSE Duncan Niederauer along with Mike Novogratz’s crypto merchant bank Galaxy Digital, global financial services firm BTIG, fintech firm Paxos and crypto liquidity solutions provider GSR.
