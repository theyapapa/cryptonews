We will buy one random coin for 1 btc every 1-2 mins 10 times (total buy amount - 10 btc).

YoBit is a Russia-based digital currency exchange founded in 2015, which offers access to hundreds of digital currencies.

However, it remained unclear whether the exchange was aware of the pump and dump activity, as Yobit reportedly did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.
