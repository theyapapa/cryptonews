Finney, the world’s purportedly first blockchain-enabled smartphone, will soon be available for purchase in Bangladesh.

According to a report by local newspaper The Daily Star on Sept. 9, the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission approved the phone for import in August and it will be available on the Bangladeshi market in October.

## Mobile Phones in Bangladesh

Finney’s launch in Bangladesh comes amid a trend of growing smartphone ownership in the country.

Per GSMA, the increasingly urbanized population has been buying more smartphones as cheaper devices come to market, and in this regard, Finney’s price is more comparable with high-end phones available in Bangladesh.

Finney debuted last year with a cost of $999, while the Samsung Galaxy S10 is available on local phone market MobileDokan for 74,900 taka ($894).

## Built-in blockchain and wallet features 

Switzerland-based Sirin Labs developed the phone following one of the five-largest initial coin offerings of 2017 ($157.8 million).

Sirin Labs' co-founder and co-CEO Moshe Hogeg said that Finney — which is manufactured by electronics giant Foxconn Technology Group — brings multiple facets of blockchain and crypto into one device:

"Before the Finney, you needed a ledger, you needed a computer, you needed wallet software and then you needed to go to an exchange, and then you could convert.
