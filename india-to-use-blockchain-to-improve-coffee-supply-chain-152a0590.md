The Coffee Board of India has launched a pilot blockchain-based e-marketplace in order to integrate coffee farmers with markets.

The Coffee Board — an organization backed by the MCI to promote coffee production in India — has rolled out an e-marketplace for coffee producers in order to reduce the number of intermediaries between coffee growers and buyers.

The product will reportedly be delivered in the form of an application and aims to improve transparency and traceability of coffee produced in India “from bean to cup.”

To implement the project, the Coffee Board collaborated with M/s Eka Plus, а digital commodity management platforms for аgriculture.

There are over 350,000 coffee growers in India, according to Business Line.

Blockchain has been actively adopted by food producers around the world in a bid to bring more efficiency to their supply chains.

Recently, the United States National Pork Board partnered with startup ripe.io to test out a blockchain platform for pork supply chains.
