The U.S. Department of the Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Sigal Mandelker urged crypto industry players and regulators to prevent the illicit use of cryptocurrencies in a speech Dec. 3.

Speaking at the Financial Crimes Enforcement Conference on Dec. 3, Mandelker addressed the issue of mitigating risks related to emerging technologies, including digital currencies, which could potentially be used for nefarious purposes.

Mandelker stressed that financial institutions and cryptocurrency services providers must combat illicit activity and the risks of assisting bad actors.

“The digital currency industry must harden its networks and undertake the steps necessary to prevent illicit actors from exploiting its services,” she said.

Mandelker also called on international regulators to strengthen anti-money laundering (AML) and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) frameworks in regards to digital currencies.

Mandelker added:

“The lack of AML/CFT regulation of virtual currency exchangers, hosted wallets, and other providers — and, indeed, of the broader digital asset ecosystem — across jurisdictions exacerbates the associated money laundering and other illicit financing risks.”

For the first time ever, OFAC attributed digital currency addresses associated with designated individuals,” Mandelker said.
