Gemini, the cryptocurrency exchange founded by the Winklevoss twins, is joining crypto-friendly bank Silvergate’s Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN) to speed fiat transfers.

## Real-time fiat money transfers

Gemini announced the move in an official blog post on Aug. 27.

According to the announcement, the main benefit of the exchange’s partnership with Silvergate is that Gemini’s institutional investor clients can withdraw and deposit United States dollars from their accounts at any time.

Integrating with SEN’s API reportedly enables Gemini to process their customers’ deposit and withdrawal requests automatically, in real time.

## Silvergate’s growth in Q4 2018

According to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Silvergate gained almost 60 new crypto customers in the last quarter of 2018.

Per the filing, Silvergate served 542 clients involved in digital currency, whereas it reported 483 to the SEC in September 2018.

In the more recent filing, Silvergate summarized the scale of the crypto market.
