Canadian exchange Coinsquare has acquired software allowing traditional ATMs to sell cryptocurrency such as bitcoin (BTC), according to a press release on July 3.

Coinsquare announced a controlling investment in Just Cash, a United States-based fintech startup that has developed a software that allows users to purchase crypto directly through traditional ATM machines without the need of additional hardware or mobile application.

Coinsquare CEO Cole Diamond says that the new initiative reflects the company’s mission of bringing mainstream adoption to the crypto industry.

According to Diamond, enabling crypto purchases through ATMs will make cryptocurrency “finally reach the masses.”

Though the press release does not specify how many ATMs Coinsquare is targeting for the upgrade, the startup nevertheless can now offer crypto capabilities for millions of existing ATMs around the world.

Diamond notes:

“By using the millions of existing ATMs around the world, we can now bridge the gap and give new users the easiest and most familiar experience to purchase cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin is new and unfamiliar to many, but ATMs are not.”
