Authorities in the United Kingdom city of Belfast have partnered with Israeli cryptocurrency firm Colu to issue their own blockchain-powered token, a press release confirmed on May 8.

Colu, which operates local blockchain-based cryptocurrency ecosystems in four cities, will issue belfast coin later this year in a bid to support local businesses.

The cryptocurrency scheme comes as Belfast participates in the Rockefeller Foundation’s 100 Resilient Cities project, and will significantly benefit its progress, according to Colu.

“Being selected to be part of the city currency challenge means an important opportunity for Belfast, and I'm delighted that this has been made possible through our partnership with 100 Resilient Cities, and working with Colu,” Belfast Lord Mayor Councillor Deirdre Hargey commented in the press release.

“Belfast Coin will make a tremendous contribution to the city's development - Economically, socially, environmentally and beyond,” said Colu CEO and co-founder, Amos Meiri.

“Just as importantly though, Belfast Coin will bring all the different elements of the city closer to each other, by empowering residents, businesses, NGOs, community groups and educational institutions to work together towards the same goals.”

In December of last year, the Canadian city of Calgary also announced plans to launch its own digital currency for paying for goods and services at local shops.
