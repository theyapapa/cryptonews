Total market cap of the top 100 cryptocurrencies is currently $250.6 billion according to the data on Coin360’s summary table.

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the CEO of blockchain venture capital firm Digital Currency Group (DCG), Barry Silbert, says that crypto price trends indicate that the crypto bear market may be finished for now.

Bitcoin price analyst Oliver Isaacs has remained bullish on BTC despite its recent decline, predicting that it will rally up to $25,000 by late 2019 or early 2020.

Silbert commented on insurance giant Fidelity’s recent BTC custody option, while Isaacs pointed to corporate giants such as Microsoft, Amazon, Starbucks and Whole Foods who now have cryptocurrency payments options available to the public.
