EToro, a United Kingdom-based exchange and social network for investors and traders, has rolled out trading support for Tezos (XTZ) on Aug. 5.

As eToro tweeted today, Tezos, the 16th-top cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is now available for trading on the platform.

According to a press release, Tezos has become the 15th crypto asset to join eToro, following Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), XRP, Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Litecoin (LTC), Ethereum Classic (ETC), Dash (DASH), Stellar (XLM), NEO, EOS, Cardano (ADA), IOTA (MIOTA), ZCash (ZEC) and Tron (TRX).

EToro co-founder and CEO Yoni Assia said that Tezos is making progress, stressing that some banks are already choosing the Tezos blockchain to issue security token offerings.

In the press release, Assia emphasized that the new move was a part of eToro’s mission to allow investors to get access to more assets, claiming:

“As we see financial institutions move more into the world of crypto, it is important that ordinary investors can take advantage of these technological developments, which is why we're excited to be adding coins like Tezos to eToro.”
