Bitcoin price remains around 4.7% down versus the start of last weekend, something which at least one major analyst now thinks could flip to the upside.

Regular market commentator Josh Rager said he was of neutral sentiment as long as Bitcoin traded between $9,690 and $10,586, with bullish or bearish signs only occurring outside that corridor.

Meanwhile, the Twitter account known as PlanB highlighted data demonstrating that Bitcoin price bull runs increasingly correlate with lows in mining difficulty.

As Cointelegraph reported, difficulty — the amount of effort required for miners to validate blocks of transactions — hit new highs this month, but Bitcoin’s 2019 price expansion started at a point when difficulty bottomed out.

1-2% gains characterized the top twenty cryptocurrencies by market cap Saturday.
