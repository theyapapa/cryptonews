An 18-year-old hacker was referred to prosecutors in the Japanese city of Utsunomiya for stealing cryptocurrency, local news outlet Japan Today reported on March 14.

The cybercriminal allegedly hacked Monappy, a digital wallet which can be installed on a smartphone, and stole 15 million yen ($134,196) of cryptocurrency between Aug. 14 and Sept. 1 of last year.

The hacker reportedly used the Tor software that enables users to anonymize web traffic.

According to Japan Today, the hacker admitted to the allegations.

The attacker submitted multiple cryptocurrency transfer requests to his own account, which overwhelmed the system and allowed him to direct more funds to his account.

As Cointelegraph Japan previously reported, there was no impact on the cold wallet, which held 54.2 percent of Monappyâ€™s total balances, and no user information, such as email addresses and passwords, was stolen.

Following an initial hack, the cybercriminals often move stolen funds to a plethora of wallets and exchanges in order to cover their tracks.
