The company behind a cryptocurrency trading bot is encouraging beginners and experts alike to give automation a try — and says users of all backgrounds can save time by using their technology.

Trade Santa says its interface means they have the chance to make their assets work for them, all by configuring the bot’s parameters around their strategies and connecting it with their chosen exchange.

Using settings that include Take Profit Level, Order Volume and averaging options, Trade Santa says these users can set up a bot that is capable of placing buy and sell orders automatically — exactly as they would have done themselves.

According to Trade Santa’s website, 1,808 trading bots created by users are active so far — and in total, more than 103,800 deals had been completed successfully at the time of writing.

Compatibility with three more exchanges is in the pipeline for the future, with Trade Santa hoping to offer automated trading strategies for crypto users who rely on BitMEX, Huobi and OKEX.

In its FAQs section, Trade Santa stresses that profits are not guaranteed and that it is important for all users to perform thorough research on their trading strategies before configuring the algorithms that will make them happen.
