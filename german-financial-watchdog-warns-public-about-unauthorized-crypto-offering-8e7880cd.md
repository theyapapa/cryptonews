The German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) issued a warning Nov. 29 that a firm called Platin Genesis DCC is not authorized or approved by the proper authorities.

In the warning, BaFin states that Platin Genesis was advertising a "Platinum Coin Crypto Fund" on social media, which it claimed was “approved and released by BaFin.”

Per BaFin, the firm does not have permission under section 34 of the German Banking Act to conduct banking activities or offer financial services.

The firm is not under BaFin’s supervision.

Earlier this month, BaFin ordered a partial cessation of activities of U.K.-based crypto-related firm Finatex Ltd.

BaFin has maintained a hawkish stance toward ICOs, and has called for international regulations in the sector.

Last month, BaFin chairman Felix Hufeld said that “the number (of ICOs) and the volume (of money) per ICO are both getting higher.
