The number of lobbies working on blockchain technology issues in Washington D.C. tripled in 2018, politics-oriented news outlet Politico reported on March 18.

The number of entities lobbying on digital currencies and blockchain reportedly grew almost thrice in the course of the past year, reaching 33 projects in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 12 in the same period of 2017.

Blockchain companies purportedly face more difficulties when it comes to the technology’s deployment outside digital currencies.

Last year, major industry leaders such crypto exchange Coinbase, technology startup Protocol Labs, as well as the Digital Currency Group and Polychain Capital, formed the “first” lobbying group representing the blockchain industry in Washington D.C.

Recently, Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the current Republican Minority Leader in the United States House of Representatives, said that blockchain can make the Congress a more efficient and transparent place.

McCarthy stated:

“Blockchain is changing and revolutionizing the security of the financial industry.

Why would we wait around and why wouldn’t we institute blockchain on our own, to be able to check the technology but also the transparency of our own legislative process?”
