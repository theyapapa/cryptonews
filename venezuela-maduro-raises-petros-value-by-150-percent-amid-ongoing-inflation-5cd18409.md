# Venezuela: Maduro Raises Petro’s Value By 150 Percent Amid Ongoing Inflation ...

###### 2018-12-03 12:12

Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro has raised the reference value of the national cryptocurrency, Petro, against the background of the country’s ongoing hyperinflation, the president’s official Twitter tweeted Nov. 30.

According to major Latin American television channel TeleSur, Maduro first announced the new Petro rate on Thursday.

According to Bloomberg’s Cafe Con Leche Index, which tracks hyperinflation in Venezuela using an average price of coffee cup as an example, the annual inflation rate in the country has climbed up to 200,000 percent.

As Cointelegraph reported in August, Maduro made Petro a unit of account within the country, tying salaries and a pricing system for goods and services to the oil-backed national cryptocurrency.

The official sale of Petro in Venezuela started this November, with several top officials including Maduro purchasing it via the official website.

MADURO’S CLAIMS ON PETRO (PIC ATTACHED TO TRELLO CARD)

Experts are concerned about the actual existence of Petro after a Reuter's report on the nature of the state-owned coin, issued in August, that turned up little evidence of the coin’s oil-backed reserves.

Other experts told news outlet Wired that Petro was nothing more than a "smoke curtain" to conceal Maduro's recent failure to reanimate the national fiat currency, the sovereign bolivar.
