Data from Cointelegraph’s price tracker, Coin360, CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap confirm the ongoing battle within the top ten altcoin assets, with ETH trading around $90.86 compared with BCH on $88.63 at press time.

Previously, BCH had traded above the market price of ETH since its creation in August 2017.

A contentious hard fork in November caused BCH to split into two chains, the second being Bitcoin Cash “Satoshi’s Vision,” now with the ticker BSV.

BSV’s price began to show inverse correlation with the majority of crypto assets, fluctuating according to activity in Bitcoin (BTC) markets before drifting downwards to almost match BCH in price by mid-December.
