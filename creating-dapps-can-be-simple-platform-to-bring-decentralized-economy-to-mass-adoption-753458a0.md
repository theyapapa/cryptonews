A new project from Dubai, HetaChain, is developing a universal blockchain platform with “industrial scale computational capabilities.”

## Solving blockchain issues

The new Heta Blockchain 3.0 Platform, launched in 2018 by Relam Investment and its founder, Sultan Ali Rashed Lootah, runs a hybrid of the Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) and a Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) consensus mechanisms which are designed to bring security to fight against cyberattacks.

## Mainchain

The core element of HetaChain is Mainchain, the place for storing all of the public tokens.

The tokens will be validated by master nodes and Mainchain will also generate multiple private chains that can be private channels for different users like a person, a company or an organization.

There will be one more Relam Investments’ project powered by HetaChain technology and based on the smart contracts.

## Hetachain team

The founder, chairman and CEO of HetaChain is Sultan Ali Rashed Lootah, who has been a vice chairman of Mashreqbank PSC since March 18, 2015 and its director since 1996.

The co-founders of the project are Mr. Ali Juma AlAjme – director of the United Arab Emirate’s Ministry of Health and Prevention’s IT Department, and Duy Phuong Nguyen, the vice chairman of Relam Investment.
