In Q3, institutional investment contribution reportedly increased to 70 percent, however, in comparison with the two previous quarters, the dollar-value invested remained lower.

The Bitcoin Investment Trust saw 73 percent of inflows, while 27 percent were into Grayscale products pegged to other digital assets.

The first positive quarterly returns for Grayscale in 2018 were generated by Bitcoin Investment Trust and XRP Investment Trust.

“The average weekly inflow into Bitcoin Investment Trust was $4.5 million, down from the year-to-date average of $5.5 million.

The average weekly inflow into “Non-Bitcoin” investment products was $1.7 million, down from the year-to-date average of $2.9 million,” Grayscale specifies.

Grayscale further notes that, despite the majority of new investment in Q3 going into Bitcoin Investment Trust, investors are diversifying their portfolios into other digital assets, with 66 percent and 34 percent respectively.

Shares of Bitcoin Investment Trust reportedly dropped by around 80 percent since BTC hit almost $20,000 last December.
