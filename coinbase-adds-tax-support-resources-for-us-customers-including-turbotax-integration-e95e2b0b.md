American cryptocurrency exchange and wallet service Coinbase has added resources for customers in the United States to claim crypto trades on their taxes, according to an official blog post on Jan. 24.

In addition to adding an educational guide on crypto and taxes, Coinbase has also integrated with popular tax software TurboTax.

According to the blog post, users of Coinbase.com and Coinbase Pro will be able to automatically import transactions into a new, crypto-specific section of TurboTax Premier.

Coinbase says that it provided the new resources in order to make the platform easier to use after hearing confusion from the community regarding crypto transactions on their taxes.

Christine Sandler, head of sales at Coinbase said:

“We launched our OTC business as a complement to our exchange business because we found a lot of institutions were using OTC as an on-ramp for crypto trading.”

Coinbase has previously launched educational programs to teach users about the basics of cryptocurrencies.

In December 2018, the exchange introduced “Coinbase Earn,” a platform wherein users can learn about cryptocurrencies as they earn them.
