The Viettel Enterprise Solutions Corporation has set a goal to become Vietnam’s leading blockchain technology provider in five years, local news outlet Viet Nam News reported Oct. 25.

The Viettel Enterprise Solutions Corporation was established earlier in October to focus on providing information and communication technology solutions to the governmental and commercial sectors, and to assist in building a digital government.

Speaking at a workshop called “Blockchain at Viettel,” the company’s deputy general director Ngô Vĩnh Quý reportedly said that Viettel is eager to keep pace with development trends, including blockchain technology.

Ngô assured that the corporation has the necessary resources, including financing, specialists, and network infrastructure to learn and deploy blockchain.

Viettel Enterprise Solutions Corporation has already developed a blockchain-based solution to improve file management in the healthcare sector.

Some other Asian countries have already deployed blockchain technology in their telecoms networks.

Also in July, China’s three major telecoms operators — China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom — launched a blockchain research group, which aims to “build a trustworthy blockchain application team to explore the blockchain area” and seeks to increase understanding of “new applications in the area of ​​blockchain digital assets, telecommunication assets and next-generation telecommunication network.”
