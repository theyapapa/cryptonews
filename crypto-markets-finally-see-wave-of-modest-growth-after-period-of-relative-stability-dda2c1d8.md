Bitcoin (BTC) has seen a relatively strong boost, by press time growing almost 2 percent on the day to trade solidly above the $6,600 mark at $6,664.

That same day, a Bloomberg article underscored the top coin’s marked price stability of late, proclaiming that Bitcoin had “hit an inflection point with volatility at a 17-month low.”

On its weekly chart, Bitcoin is now just over one percent in the green, with monthly growth a strong 8 percent.
