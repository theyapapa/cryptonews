# South Africa and Crypto – a Conservatively Optimistic Approach ...

###### 2018-10-06 08:10

This was the case in South Africa, where the South African Revenue Services (SARS) made it clear to registered taxpayers that they would be liable to pay tax on cryptocurrency gains.

“Cryptocurrencies are neither official South African tender nor widely used and accepted in South Africa as a medium of payment or exchange.

In that very document, the SARB went as far to say that cryptocurrencies won’t pose any threat to the South African Rand, or financial institutions:

“Given the current landscape and information currently available, the Bank contends that VCs pose no significant risk to financial stability, price stability or the National Payment System.”

## Task force looking at crypto

Given that the SARB’s first report on cryptocurrencies is nearly 5 years old, the institution has since launched a Fintech task group that will handle cryptocurrency and fintech developments in the country.

Groepe said the bank wants to make sure that cryptocurrencies, and their trade, are still adhering to South African laws:

“We want to ensure or establish whether there is still compliance with the relevant financial surveillance or exchange-control regulations.”

## Reserve Bank tests pilot blockchain payment system - Project Khokha

In addition to establishing this regulatory body for the South African crypto industry, the SARB has also forged ahead with a proof of concept for a blockchain-based payment system.

While no official, blockchain-based payment system has been launched from the proof-of-concept, the exercise has provided first-hand experience of the capabilities of distributed ledger technology and how it could possibly improve the current South African payment system:

“One objective of Project Khokha is to provide a better understanding of how South African Multiple Option Settlement (SAMOS) system would integrate with a DLT system.
