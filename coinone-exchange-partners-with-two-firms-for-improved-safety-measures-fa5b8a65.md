###### 2019-08-07 21:08

Major South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Coinone has partnered with cybersecurity audit company CertiK and disclosures company Xangle to provide more safety and transparency for their crypto investors.

According to their announcement, CertiK and Xangle will provide public disclosure information as well as smart contract audit information, respectively.

Certik, on the other hand, will reportedly provide audit information as a preventative measure against issues with code security exploits, as well as to review projects at a code level, among other things.

Certik will perform audits for projects listed on Coinone, as per the announcement.

## A busy blockchain security company

In addition to its recent partnership with Coinone, CertiK recently launched a native blockchain on July 22.

DeepSEA is a language which purportedly guarantees security due to the code itself, and its development was funded by the Ethereum Foundation as well as the open source blockchain project Qtum.

The nodes of the Certik Chain will reportedly run on CertiKOS, which was described in the announcement as a “fully verified hypervisor / concurrent OS kernel” granting military-grade security against hacking attempts.
