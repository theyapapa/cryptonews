Gemini crypto exchange, founded by brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, completed a SOC 2 Type 1 security compliance review, according to a post made on their Medium blog on Jan 29.

According to the announcement, Gemini is the first in the cryptocurrency industry to undergo such an audit.

The audit was conducted by ‘Big Four’ auditing firm Deloitte, which reviewed Gemini’s exchange application, infrastructure, underlying customer database, and its cryptocurrency storage systems that hold the keys of Gemini’s online and offline wallets.

Gemini also noted that, in addition to the SOC 2 Type 1 test, it would undergo an SOC Type 2 review in 2019, in order to further assure compliance and a high security standard.

In October 2018, Gemini secured insurance coverage for custodied digital assets from lending services firm Aon.

Earlier this month, Gemini started a new ad campaign calling for better regulation of the crypto space.

The head of marketing at Gemini, Chris Roan, told the Wall Street Journal:

“We believe that investors coming into cryptocurrency deserve the exact same protections as investors in more traditional markets, adhering to the same standards, practices, regulations and compliance protocols.”
