Regulators and Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) — such as exchanges from different countries — met in Osaka for two days and discussed how to implement the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) latest guidance on how to prevent cryptocurrencies being used for money laundering.

Cointelegraph asked the FATF Secretariat and different VASPs at the V-20 about their thoughts on the new rule.

## Travel rule

The travel rule refers to section 7(b) in the Interpretative Note to Recommendation 15 in the FATF guideline, which requires VASPs to collect and transfer customer information during transactions.

The FATF has said that local authorities and VASPs have one year to come up with country-specific rules based on the travel rule.

## Technical challenges 

There are at least three challenges brought about by the travel rule that various VASPs at the V-20 mentioned to Cointelegraph.

According to a person who participated in one of the closed sessions at V-20, a crypto industry member suggested that the FATF use public data already available on the blockchain to have AML, thus creating a system in which the travel rule doesn’t have to be applied.

The banking industry may be pressuring FATF to make rules in favor of them, one of the participants at the V-20 suspected:

“I think these rules are really just designs to protect banks.
