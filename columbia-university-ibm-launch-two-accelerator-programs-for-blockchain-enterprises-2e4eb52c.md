IBM and Columbia University have announced two blockchain accelerator programs that aim to help startups in the space innovate at scale, according to an IBM news release Nov. 19.

Both programs form part of the Columbia-IBM Center for Blockchain and Data Transparency, a joint innovation center that was established by the tech giant and U.S. ivy league school this summer.

According to the release, each program will support ten startups, offering them a network of business mentors, technical support, access to Columbia’s student talent and “research community,” design assistance, and IBM cloud technology resources.

The eight-week Columbia Blockchain Launch Accelerator, set to take place in New York City, has been designed for pre-seed “idea-stage” companies that are affiliated with either Columbia or another NYC-based school, as the release outlines.

The second eight-week program, dubbed IBM Blockchain Accelerator, is targeted at later-stage companies globally, and will aim to help participants establish a business network and client base for their blockchain application.

As reported earlier this fall, fellow New York-based school New York University (NYU) has claimed to be the “first” U.S. school to offer a major in blockchain technology, to be provided by the NYU Stern School of Business.

IBM, which has its own Hyperledger-powered cloud blockchain platform, has made major inroads into the enterprise blockchain space.
