Mark Karpeles — the former CEO of now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox — has affirmed that he is not guilty in the final argument for his trial, Cointelegraph Japan reports Dec. 27.

In court in Tokyo on Thursday, Karpeles apologized for not being able to avoid his exchange being hacked, but also reiterated the idea that he is innocent.

Mark Karpeles has been charged with embezzlement of approximately 340 million yen (about $3 million) from the exchange and manipulating its data to inflate its cash balance.

Karpeles allegedly transferred 340 million yen belonging to customers from a Mt. Gox account to his personal account between September and December 2013.

As Cointelegraph recently reported, prosecutors asked for a ten-year prison sentence for Karpeles, who is currently facing the charges in Japan.

During his trial, Karpeles has repeatedly denied having stolen money or manipulated Mt. Gox ledgers.

According to today’s report, the ruling for Karpeles’ trial is set to be delivered on March 15, 2019.
