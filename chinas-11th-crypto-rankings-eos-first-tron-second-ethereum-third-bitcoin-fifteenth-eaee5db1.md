China has released its latest government-sponsored rankings of major cryptocurrencies on March 22, placing Bitcoin (BTC) in 15th, while EOS keeps its top spot.

Tron (TRX) came in second, after overtaking Ethereum (ETH) in February.

The crypto rankings by China’s Center for Information and Industry Development (CCID) were first announced in May last year.

In this eleventh edition of the index, EOS has remained as the top-ranked blockchain, a place occupied by the platform since June 2018.

The eleventh CCID Global Public Chain Technology Evaluation Index puts Tron on the second spot, as did the tenth edition.

The ninth edition had previously placed Ethereum in the second spot, while Tron wasn’t present at all on the list.

In the tenth edition, Bitcoin had moved from number 15 to number 13, now falling back down two spots to occupy 15th place again.
