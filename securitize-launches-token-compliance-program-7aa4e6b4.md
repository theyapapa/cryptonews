Securitize, a compliance platform and protocol for token issuers backed by United States crypto exchange Coinbase, is launching its Securitize Ready Program, according to a press release shared with Cointelegraph on April 9.

Per the announcement, the program includes such industry majors as Coinbase Custody, OpenFinance, Rialto Trading, CBlock Capital and others.

Users of the Securitize Ready Program will be able to use the various services offered by the partner firms to issue security tokens on the Securitize platform.

The announcement further states:

“Securitize’s DS Protocol maintains compliance during secondary trading and enables automated features such as share buy-backs, dividends, voting, and more.”

Late last year, Securitize closed a Series A funding round led by Blockchain Capital that raised $12.75 million.

In January 2019, Securitize joined the IBM Blockchain Accelerator program.

According to a report, Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo said that the firm’s goal is to build a debt issuance platform using blockchain technology.
