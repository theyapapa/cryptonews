Jeremy Allaire, the CEO of crypto investment app Circle, has called on global economies to develop coordinated regulation of cryptocurrencies in an interview with Reuters Oct. 22.

The CEO of the Goldman Sachs-backed crypto firm claimed that the global community should develop universal international rules for regulating the crypto space.

Claiming that for the crypto industry “ultimately there needs to be normalization at the G20 level,” Allaire has paid special attention to the regulation of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), as well as stressed the need to adopt a coordinated approach towards crypto market manipulation and know-your-customer (KYC) policies.

In that regard, Allaire also commented on the recent announcement from the global money laundering regulator the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Oct. 19.

The France-based global watchdog stated they had establish regulation for crypto exchanges, digital wallets, and other crypto-related firms, implying mandatory licences and frameworks in order to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.

In July, G20 finance ministers and central bank governors confirmed that the crypto industry would remain functioning without strict universal regulation.

The participants decided to push the deadline for developing specific crypto regulations to at least October, following a four-month consultation period.
