# Are Mastercard and VISA Cutting Out Unregulated Crypto Brokers and ICOs? ...

###### 2018-10-18 17:10

On October 12, Finance Magnates reported that payment giants Mastercard and VISA will both soon group cryptocurrency and Initial Coin Offering (ICO) jurisdictions in a new “high risk” category.

Thus, non-regulated brokers would reportedly be classified as “high-risk securities merchants” by VISA and Mastercard, brining similar limitations outside of the EU.

## Some of the limitations have reportedly come into force, but remain unconfirmed

Allegedly, Finance Magnates’ sources stated that the new classification by Mastercard had started on October 15, while VISA was planning to implement a similar grouping in December of this year.

## There were similar (also unconfirmed) reports in May

Previously, in May, Finance Magnates reported similar news, announcing that Mastercard was going to single out binary options, CFDs, forex, cryptocurrencies, and ICOs as “high risk” businesses in a “well-coordinated campaign” that involved “several regulators and government agencies.”

At the time, Finance Magnates wrote that Mastercard’s regulation was “effective from the 12th of Oct. 2018, which is 6 months since the payment processors have received the letter,” with the changes affecting “all transactions globally via Mastercard, Debit Mastercard, and Maestro.”

Starting then, every payment processor processing the transactions of a high-risk securities merchant are supposed to show to Mastercard that adequate due diligence has been applied.

## Both VISA and Mastercard seem anti-crypto, pro-blockchain

Either way, it seems logical that the largest credit players on the market want to put unregulated players under more scrutiny and dodge potential risks, as seems to be a general trend: many countries have at least announced their regulatory frameworks, while the US regulators seems to have extended their purview to fight scammers on the market.
