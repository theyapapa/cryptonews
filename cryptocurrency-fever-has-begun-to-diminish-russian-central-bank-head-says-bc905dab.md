The head of Russia’s central bank, Elvira Nabiullina, believes that “crypto fever” is beginning to diminish, major Russian news agency RIA Novosti reports Thursday, Oct. 18.

Nabiullina, while speaking at finance innovation forum Finnopolis held in the South Russian city of Sochi, said that she believes cryptocurrencies and blockchain are now being treated more rationally:

"Fortunately, the crypto fever has begun to diminish.

Nabiullina is well-known for her gloomy approach to cryptocurrencies and the technologies behind them.

This year, Nabiullina called coins, “money surrogates,” stating they would not be featured on Russian exchanges.

Furthermore, she has said that the central bank was “categorically against” regulating cryptocurrency or equating it with foreign currency.

Despite the conservative stance taken by the central bank, major Russian banks are reportedly interested in working with crypto assets.

In order to clarify the supposed contradictions in the existing bill, a lobby group, the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs (RSPP), has started working on an alternative crypto regulation draft.
