PwC Luxembourg, a subsidiary of the world’s second largest professional services firm, will start accepting Bitcoin (BTC) payments starting Oct. 1 2019.

## “Bitcoin cannot be compromised”

The Luxembourg branch of the Big Four auditing firm announced the initiative in an official press release on Sept. 2, claiming that the move shows the firm’s commitment to comply with the needs of clients as well as support the growing national crypto ecosystem.

In the announcement, PwC Luxembourg expressed confidence in the major cryptocurrency Bitcoin, calling it the “first peer-to-peer payment mechanism that cannot be compromised and is based on a decentralised trust model.”

The Luxembourg firm added that it has partnered with an unnamed local regulated exchange in order to provide the best experience of its new crypto payment option.

PwC Luxembourg wrote:

“The Firm acknowledges the challenges of this move and has carefully reviewed its internal policies and procedures to meet the standards required by the crypto industry and closely collaborated with a local regulated exchange to provide the best payment experience.”

PwC Luxembourg’s move to accept crypto payments stems from the positive stance to the industry by its parent company PwC.

In a recent press release, PwC said that it has more than 400 staff working on blockchain and crypto initiatives supported by over 100 technical team members.
