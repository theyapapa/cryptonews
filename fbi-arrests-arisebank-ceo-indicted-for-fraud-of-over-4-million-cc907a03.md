Prior to that, in late January, Texas regulators had issued an unconditional Emergency Cease & Desist Order to the self-described ‘cryptocurrency bank,’ ordering it to halt any services to the state’s residents, given it was found to not in fact offer “banking services.”

The court documents, unsealed yesterday by attorney Erin Nealy Cox, give details of Rice’s AriseBank scheme, which he reportedly pitched as the world’s “first decentralized banking platform.”

Without disclosing his prior guilty plea to state felony charges in connection with a separate web-based business scheme, Rice solicited investors to buy the token using major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and fiat currency.

In regard to AriseBank, Rice is alleged to have falsely claimed the bank could offer customers “FDIC-insured accounts and traditional banking services, including Visa-brand credit and debit cards, in addition to cryptocurrency services.”

The attorney re-states in yesterday’s releast that Rice was in fact not authorized to offer banking services in Texas, had no access to FDIC insurance, and had no partnership with Visa at all.

As reported yesterday, the Texas Securities Commissioner has just issued an Emergency Cease & Desist Order against crypto investment firm My Crypto Mine, charging the firm and its principal with sale of unregistered securities, engagement in fraud, and public deception.

Also this month, the Texas State Securities Board issued a Cease & Desist Order to another crypto company for the sale of unregistered securities to Texas residents, the latest in a series of such interventions against unauthorized or allegedly fraudulent crypto-related firms this year.
