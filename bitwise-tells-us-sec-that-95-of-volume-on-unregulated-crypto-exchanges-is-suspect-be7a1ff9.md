# Bitwise Tells US SEC That 95% of Volume on Unregulated Crypto Exchanges is Suspect ...

95 percent of volume on unregulated exchanges appears to be fake or non-economic in nature, an analysis from cryptocurrency index fund provider Bitwise Asset Management has argued in a report dated March 20.

Bitwise reported its data and claims to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as part of a proposed rule change for its application to launch a Bitcoin (BTC) Exchange Traded Fund (ETF).

The analysis opens with the argument that while an ostensible ~$6 billion in daily traded volume for Bitcoin is reported across the spot markets:

“Under the hood the exchanges that report the highest volumes are unrecognizable.

Bitwise claims that roughly 95 percent of reported volume is fake and that the real market for BTC is thus “significantly smaller, more orderly, and more regulated than commonly understood” — amounting in reality to $273 million.

Bitwise first analyzes regulated exchanges — using Coinbase Pro as a case study — to reveal the nature of the trading patterns it deems to be trustworthy.

Coinbase Pro reported around $27 million in daily traded volume of BTC at the time of Bitwise’s analysis — as compared with $480 million reported by Coinbene.

Bitwise’s report concludes that its overall findings “demonstrate that this ETF application \[for its Bitwise Bitcoin ETF Trust\] meets both” of the SEC’s conditions for how a BTC ETF could satisfy the requirements of the Exchange Act.
