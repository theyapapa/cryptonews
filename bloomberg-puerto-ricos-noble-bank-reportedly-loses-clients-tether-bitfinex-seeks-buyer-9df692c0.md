# Bloomberg: Puerto Rico’s Noble Bank Reportedly Loses Clients Tether, Bitfinex, Seeks Buyer ...

Puerto Rico’s Noble Bank International, which is known for reportedly opening accounts for USD-backed token Tether and crypto exchange Bitfinex, is allegedly searching for a buyer, Bloomberg reports Thursday, October 2.

Citing an unnamed person familiar with the case, Bloomberg reports that Noble Bank has lost Tether and Bitfinex as clients, among others, and is currently on the search for a buyer.

Noble Bank officials declined to comment the matter to Bloomberg, while Tether and Bitfinex were not immediately available for the comments.

bank Wells Fargo dropped Tether and Bitfinex — who share a CEO, Jan Ludovicus van der Velde — as clients, Bloomberg notes.

Tether and Bitfinex were looking for other banks when Noble — one of the only two full-reserve banks in Puerto Rico that publicly operates with crypto assets — emerged as a possible option, according to a Bitmex report.

Bloomberg notes that Noble was audited by Puerto Rico’s bank regulator last year in a move that “raised concerns,” but that the bank has not been “faulted publicly.”

As experts told Cointelegraph in early 2018, Puerto Rico was seen by many as a possible crypto paradise, as U.S. taxpayers were not obliged to include incomes from sources within Puerto Rico to in their tax declarations.
