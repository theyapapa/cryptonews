Florida-based United American Corp. (UnitedCorp) has purportedly filed a lawsuit against Bitmain, Bitcoin.com, Roger Ver, and the Kraken Bitcoin Exchange, according to a press release published Dec. 6.

UnitedCorp alleges that the defendants planned a scheme to take control of the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) network.

The suit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida alleges that the defendants jointly used unfair methods and practices to manipulate the BCH network for their benefit and detriment of UnitedCorp and other BCH stakeholders.

The release further specifies:

“UnitedCorp believes that the defendants colluded to effectively hijack the Bitcoin Cash network after the November 15, 2018 scheduled software update with the intent of centralizing the network — all in violation of the accepted standards and protocols associated with Bitcoin since its inception.”

On Nov. 15, the BCH network underwent an update, which divided the community into two main camps, those who support Bitcoin Cash ABC and those who support Bitcoin Cash SV.

UnitedCorp states that the defendants took control of the coin’s network right after the upgrade using “rented hashing.”

UnitedCorp also alleges that on Nov. 20 the Bitcoin ABC development team put a “poison pill” into the blockchain by way of a “Deep Reorg Prevention” in order to strengthen control over the blockchain ledger.
