Decentralized computing network Blockstack has applied to the United States Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) to launch a $50 million token sale which — if approved — would be the industry’s first SEC-qualified offering.

The sale, which is being proposed under the SEC Regulation A+ framework, would be operated via a wholly-owned subsidiary, “Blockstack Token LLC,” and involve the sale of 295 million Stacks tokens.

This latter involves the conferral of tokens in exchange for the development of applications that run on Blockstack’s decentralized application (DApp) network.

Introduced in 2012 under the Jumpstart Our Business (JOBS) Act, the SEC’s Regulation A+ exemption offers small enterprises an alternative to a traditional initial public offering.

We’ve been working with securities lawyers to create a legal framework that can enable blockchain protocols to comply with SEC regulations.”

As reported, staff at the SEC have just recently published a framework to help market participants ascertain whether or not a digital asset is deemed to be an investment contract, and therefore a security.

To date, a host of crypto industry figures and lawmakers have repeatedly called on the agency to provide greater regulatory clarity for the interaction of blockchain tokens and securities laws.
