# FATF to Release New Rules for Global Crypto Sector, Impacting Exchanges, Funds, Custodians ...

On June 21, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) will reportedly publish a note clarifying how participant nations should exercise oversight for the digital assets sector, according to FATF spokeswoman Alexandra Wijmenga-Daniel.

Per Bloomberg, the new rules will apply to a wide gamut of businesses dealing with cryptocurrencies and tokens — including crypto exchanges, custodians and crypto hedge funds.

The FATF has developed a series of recommendations recognized as the international standard for combating money laundering and the financing of illicit activities.

Bloomberg reports that the FATF rules are expected to require firms ranging from major spot exchanges such as Coinbase to asset managers like Fidelity Investments to gather data on all clients initiating transactions worth over $1,000 or 1,000 euros.

Some industry participants have reportedly voiced concerns that blockchain technology would have to be fundamentally restructured — or otherwise a complex parallel system constructed between exchanges — in order to satisfy new reporting requirements, while others are concerned about the toll that increased compliance costs will exact on industry businesses.

Jesse Spiro, from blockchain intelligence firm Chainalysis, has by contrast reportedly argued that the FATF’s forthcoming guidance is necessary for the industry.

As recently reported, the United States Financial Crimes Enforcement Network has recently issued new guidance for any entity whose activities fall under the purview of the country’s Bank Secrecy Act.
