More than a quarter of younger Germans is ready to buy cryptocurrencies, according to a recent poll by the German Consumer Centers of Hesse and Saxony published Monday, Nov. 5.

More than a half of respondents — 55 percent — claim they have heard of cryptocurrencies.

When asked about their perception of the risk factor of cryptocurrencies, 70 percent of participants said they find crypto trading ‘risky’ or ‘very risky’.

While 54 percent of people aged 30 to 39 consider cryptocurrency investments dangerous, 28 percent of respondents from 18 to 29 found purchasing cryptocurrencies to be “conceivable.”

Wolf Brandes, the finance markets team leader at the Consumer Center of Hesse writes, "Investors need to know: cryptocurrencies in terms of investment are gray capital markets.

In September, German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz stated that cryptocurrencies would not be able to replace fiat money, adding that they did not have “an economically significant importance”.

A recent survey by research service YouGov Omnibus has shown that American millennials are most interested in cryptocurrencies, with 36 percent of them saying they would rather use digital currencies than the dollar.
