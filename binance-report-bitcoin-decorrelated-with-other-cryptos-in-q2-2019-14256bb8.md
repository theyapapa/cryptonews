# Binance Report: Bitcoin Decorrelated with Other Cryptos in Q2 2019 ...

Bitcoin’s (BTC) has become less correlated with other cryptos in Q2 2019 due to a potential “flight-to-quality” in the recent bull run, according to a Binance report on crypto correlations released on July 5.

In its “2019 Q2 Crypto-Correlations Review,” Binance specified that average correlation between Bitcoin and all other major crypto assets declined to 0.61 from 0.73 in Q1 2019.

At the same time, some crypto assets have seen significant increases in correlation over the past three months, with Tezos (XTZ), Ontology (ONT) and Tron (TRX) accounting for the largest growth in average correlation with other cryptos.

In contrast, Bitcoin SV (BSV) has seen the greatest decline in average correlation, which was likely caused by delistings from Kraken and Binance exchanges, the report notes.

Dogecoin (DOGE), which was listed on Binance today, has also seen a significant decorrelation against other crypto assets in Q2, the review reads.

In the review, Binance outlined a “Binance effect,” which envisions that coins that are not listed on Binance have demonstrated lower average correlations than cryptocurrencies listed on the exchange.

In their Q1 2019 crypto correlation report, Binance found that price correlations among major crypto assets increased against the United States dollar (USD), but dropped in Bitcoin terms.
