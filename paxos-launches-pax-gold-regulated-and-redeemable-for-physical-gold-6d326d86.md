Stablecoin operator Paxos launched PAX Gold (PAXG), a gold-backed Ethereum (ETH) token.

Paxos announced the launch of the product above in a press release published on Sept. 5, claiming that it is “the first crypto-asset redeemable for physical gold.”

Per the report, each PAXG token will be backed by one fine troy ounce of London Good Delivery gold stored in professional vault facilities in London.

Users owning the tokens in question reportedly own the gold it represents but the tokens can be moved like any other ERC-20 tokens — which is substantially simpler than shipping gold.

Paxos CEO and Co-Founder Charles Cascarilla commented on the development by praising the advantages of tokenization:

“In a digital and global financial system, owning physical gold is a cumbersome, outdated investment; it's not easy to trade, divide, move or leverage against other investments.”

The company claims that on its website users can convert the tokens to and from to and from fiat currency or unallocated gold, or redeem tokens for physical gold bars.

Furthermore, token holders can allegedly also look up the serial number, brand code, gross weight, fineness, and fine weight of their gold bars.
