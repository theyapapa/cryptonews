U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) commissioner Hester Peirce expressed interest in building a non-exclusive safe harbor for token offerings.

The news was reported by Singaporean blockchain business consulting firm Jenga BCG in a press release published on Aug. 5.

The author of the release claims that Peirce was among the speakers, alongside Su Hui Tay, Deputy Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore.

In her speech, Peirce reportedly said that she is interested in building a non-exclusive safe harbor allowing issuers to offer tokens under an alternative regime with robust requirements.

To address the cross-border regulation, Peirce stated that the internationalization of markets does not need to lead to the internalization of regulation, noting:

“Regulators have had to follow the lead of the markets and work with their foreign counterparts.

\[...\] Absent an explicit decision by citizens of a jurisdiction to cede their regulatory authority to an international organization, a jurisdiction should determine what rules work best for its investors and markets.”

More precisely, she expects the technology to have a positive influence “in terms of know-your-customer, security and privacy, and the Bank of Thailand has widely deployed and used blockchain."
