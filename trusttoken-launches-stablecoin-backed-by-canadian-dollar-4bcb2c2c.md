# TrustToken Launches Stablecoin Backed by Canadian Dollar ...

###### 2019-05-01 17:05

TrustToken has released its latest stablecoin, TrueCAD, on May 1, 2019.

The latest in TrustToken’s line of fiat-backed stablecoins, its value is linked to the Canadian dollar.

TrustToken has also created a number of other stablecoins, such as TrueUSD (U.S. dollars), TrueGBP (British pounds) and TrueAUD (Australian dollars); each of these backed at a purported 1:1 ratio with their associated fiat currencies.

For now, holders can use these four stablecoins on the TrustToken app, and expect them to be listed on exchanges “over the coming weeks and months.”

TrustToken alludes to this fact in their statement about TrueCAD:

“We wanted a simple stablecoin, without the need to trust some company's hidden bank account or special algorithm.

TrueCAD and TrueAUD are two of four new stablecoins pegged to national currencies that TrueToken announced would release in 2019.

Lawyers recently confirmed in court documents that the Tether stablecoin USDT is not backed 1:1 with U.S. dollars (its reserve asset).
