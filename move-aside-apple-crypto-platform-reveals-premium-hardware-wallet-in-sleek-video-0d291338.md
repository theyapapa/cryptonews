###### 2018-11-29 01:11

A platform which aims to demystify crypto and bring it to the masses through a suite of blockchain-driven financial services has launched its latest product: a hardware wallet that combines “institutional-grade security with a consumer-friendly user experience, beautiful design and premium materials.”

The company says the hardware wallet provides a “one-of-a-kind security architecture” and supports the transfer of hundreds of different assets – and a special emphasis has been placed on simplicity and user experience.

This includes its flagship product Coinvest, a digital wallet which offers an integrated investment trading market for cryptocurrencies.

In the future, Coinvest plans to launch a digital assets wallet aimed at children – giving them the chance to learn about cryptocurrencies at a young age and learn valuable lessons about managing money through a modern take on pocket money.

## Empowering the masses

Coinvest argues that entering the crypto world has been a bewildering prospect for the public to date – with thousands of coins, hundreds of wallets and multiple exchanges vying for their attention.

According to Coinvest, it is one of the few blockchain companies in the world to have registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the US.

In November, the first iteration of the digital Coinvest Wallet launched – with the team promising new features and improvements as its ecosystem comes to life.
