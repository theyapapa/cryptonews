Ethereum wallet and decentralized app (DApp) browser Metamask has launched the public beta version of its new mobile app.

Unveiled on July 23, the app brings various features to Metamask users and syncs to the company’s existing browser plug-in.

The mobile app features a cryptocurrency wallet and DApp browser among other tools, including support for so-called Collectibles — unique, non-fungible tokens built on the Ethereum blockchain.

“Rather than just another wallet, MetaMask Mobile is a bridge to the decentralized web, with a dapp-centric browsing experience, intuitive on-boarding, and features that sync with your desktop MetaMask accounts,” the blog post continues.

The release follows increasing scrutiny of Metamask as its monthly active user base grows to over 250,000 for the desktop product.

As Cointelegraph reported, security issues are exacerbated by bad actors launching fake apps impersonating its brand.

Developers originally announced the mobile app in November 2018, at a time when cryptocurrency markets were at the lowest point of an almost year-long bear market.
