# SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce: Crypto Markets Should Self-Regulate When Possible ...

United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commissioner Hester M. Peirce has argued in favor of self-regulation for cryptocurrency markets when possible.

The commissioner made her remarks during a public talk together with former Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) chairman Gary Gensler at the MIT Bitcoin Expo 2019 on March 9.

In Gensler’s opinion, this would encompass not only trading platforms that offer security tokens or complex investment instruments, but also those that list commodities such as Bitcoin (BTC).

Gensler’s arguments in favor of extending national level regulation over a broader spectrum of crypto trading centered on improving investor protection, coordinating money laundering prevention and addressing the current regulatory and enforcement discrepancies across different states.

In a short debate with Gensler over tackling this jurisdictional regulatory fragmentation, Peirce emphasized the status quo — in which states have a statutory obligation to enforce money transmission laws under the Bank Secrecy Act, but may nonetheless regulate aspects of the cryptocurrency markets with significantly differing degrees of latitude.

She nonetheless affirmed that security offerings must comply with the SEC’s registration requirements, and supported the ongoing efforts by major crypto trading platforms to register with the agency as either exchanges or as alternative trading venues in order to be able to compliantly list security tokens.

As Cointelegraph has previously reported, Peirce enjoys a positive reputation in the crypto community, earning the moniker of “Crypto Mom” for her personal dissent over the SEC’s second decision to reject a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund proposed by the Winklevoss twins last year.
