# Mt. Gox Vulnerability Covered Up by Founder McCaleb, Lawsuit Alleges ...

The duo, who filed the lawsuit on May 19 in a court in California, allege that McCaleb was aware of “serious security risks” in the architecture of Mt. Gox back in late 2010 to early 2011, but neither followed-up to fix the issues nor disclosed the vulnerabilities to the public.

The lawsuit claims that in or before January 2011 — when the Mt. Gox account was compromised, leading to the unauthorized sale of thousands of users’ Bitcoins (BTC) — McCaleb was informed about the security flaws and was aware that more than 80,000 Bitcoin had already gone missing.

McCaleb failed to take any action to fix the security issues, but instead sold the majority of his interest in Mt. Gox to the eventual CEO of the exchange Mark Karpeles, the lawsuit claims.

The following email on April 28, 2011, obtained by The Daily Beast, suggests that McCaleb, who co-founded both Ripple and Stellar and currently serves as Stellar's chief technology officer, knew about the missing 80,000 Bitcoin but did not disclose the information to the public:

Data obtained from Bitcoin.com shows that the price of bitcoin was, on average, $1.90, as of April 28, 2011.

Indeed, as McCaleb wrote, Mt. Gox appeared to have made enough money to cover the loss of 80,000 Bitcoins, given that McCaleb came back around December 2011 to request an earnout worth $263,431 from Karpeles, in accordance with the sale agreement between the two.

However, the purported misrepresentations above led users, especially the plaintiffs, to continue trading on Mt. Gox until the exchange ultimately sought bankruptcy protection in 2014, going by the following paragraphs in the lawsuit:

"Had plaintiffs known that the representations and omissions made by defendants were inaccurate, false and misleading, and designed to induce plaintiffs into utilizing the services provided by defendants, plaintiffs would not have selected Mt. Gox to do their bitcoin trading.

A similar lawsuit filed against McCaleb by two different ex-users of Mt Gox last year showed email conversations with McCaleb that suggests that he was aware of the security flaws that had lead to Bitcoins going missing from the platform.
