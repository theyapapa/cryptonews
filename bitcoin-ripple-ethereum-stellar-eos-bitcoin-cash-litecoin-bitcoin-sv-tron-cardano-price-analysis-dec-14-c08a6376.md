###### 2018-12-14 15:12

If the BTC/USD pair bounces off the current support and breaks out of the 20-day EMA, it will be a positive sign.

The first sign of a likely change in trend will be a break out of the 20-day EMA.

A breakdown and close (UTC time frame) below $83 will resume the downtrend and can plunge the ETH/USD pair to the next support of $66.

However, in a strong downtrend it is difficult to call a bottom as the price continues to slice through support levels with ease.

## BCH/USD

After trading in a tight range for five days, Bitcoin Cash resumed its downtrend and made a new low on Dec. 18.

Though the bulls are defending the support level, if they donâ€™t manage to push the price above $29.349 within the next few days, a new low is likely.

The next lower target is a retest of the Nov. 23 low of $38.528, with a likely minor support at $57.
