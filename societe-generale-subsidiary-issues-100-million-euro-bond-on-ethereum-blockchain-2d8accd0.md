French specialized credit institution Societe Generale SFH issued a 100 million euro ($112 million) bond as a security token on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain.

Societe Generale SFH — which is a subsidiary of one of Europe's largest financial services groups, Societe Generale Group — has rolled out its first pilot project developed in collaboration with Societe Generale FORGE.

Last September, Societe Generale became one of the major financial organizations that launched a joint venture dubbed komgo SA to oversee a new blockchain-based platform for financing the trading of commodities.

The venture aims to digitize trade and commodities finance processes through a blockchain-based open platform, and was developed in partnership with the Ethereum-focused blockchain infrastructure and solutions group ConsenSys.

Earlier in April, Private bank Kleinwort Hambros, which is owned by Societe Generale, launched an exchange-traded note made up of blockchain-related companies.

The stocks reportedly included 20 companies, which are expected to profit from blockchain and distributed ledger technology adoption.

Aidoo argued that banks’ unwillingness to adopt blockchain lies in the culture within banks, and has nothing to do with the technology’s immaturity or a lack of potential use cases within financial organizations.
