# Fee Has Successfully Stabilized DAI, MakerDAO President Says ...

DAI stablecoin, which is pegged to the United States dollar, is now in a relatively stable position, according to the president and COO of MakerDAO, Steven Becker, in an Q&A session on May 2.

Becker discussed the efficacy of the stability fee alongside MakerDAO’s head of community development Richard Brown and Vishesh Choudhry of the company's Foundation Risk Team.

According to Becker, DAI is now stable thanks to the community’s implementation of the stability fee.

Becker reasoned that the fluctuations of the stablecoin’s rate are not necessarily the result of a supply/demand imbalance.

If it passes, the stability fee will land at 19.5%.

As Cointelegraph previously reported, MakerDAO users have voted to increase the stability fee on several occasions this year.

If MakerDAO implements more substantive solutions, DAI could become crypto’s ‘default’ stablecoin.
