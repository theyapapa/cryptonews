# Revolut CEO Refutes Claims of Negligence and Money Laundering Breach ...

The founder and CEO of United Kingdom-based digital banking app Revolut publicly denied allegations of a money laundering breach and negligence by the company in a blog post Mar. 1.

The latest in a series of publicity disasters to afflict Revolut, as U.K. newspaper the Telegraph last week alleged that executives had deliberately decommissioned Anti-Money Laundering (AML) software earlier last year.

According to Storonsky, Revolut had opted to revert to its previous AML systems after an upgrade failed to produce adequate security.

This roll-out did not result in a breach of any sanctions or money laundering laws and requirements — so we did not send a formal notification to the regulator.”

The firm’s overall position expectedly contrasts with banking app Monzo, which some consider to be Revolut’s rival company.

Monzo has deliberately avoided the cryptocurrency scene.

While some have urged Monzo not to pass up on cryptocurrencies, Bates said that, while crypto is important in countries and jurisdictions with highly corrupted financial systems, consumers living in countries with sound financial institutions will chose more safe and stable systems.
