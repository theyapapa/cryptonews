# Binance Singapore Launches But Offers Just One Trading Pair, Report ...

###### 2019-04-24 21:04

Binance has launched a new cryptocurrency exchange in Singapore after months of anticipation, TechCrunch reported on April 23, albeit with limited features.

Users of the platform are only able to purchase bitcoin (BTC) using Singapore dollars (SGD,) meaning far fewer trading pairs are available for consumers compared with the company’s main exchange.

The Binance Singapore website suggests that the service is being offered in conjunction with Xfers, a local payment service that claims to offer a crypto wallet approved by Singaporean regulators.

A spokesperson told TechCrunch: “Binance is excited to bring world-class blockchain technology to Singapore and we look forward to showcasing Binance’s tier one safety and security measures to the world.

As Cointelegraph reported earlier in April, CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) had said Binance was planning to open the branch in Singapore at some point this month — but further details about the fiat-to-crypto exchange service were not forthcoming.

Vertex Ventures, a subsidiary of Temasek Holdings — an investment company based in Singapore and owned by the government — announced last October that it was investing in Binance to fuel its expansion to the country.

Also on April 23, the company announced it has launched its decentralized trading platform (DEX) ahead of schedule — one week after the native blockchain that will power it, Binance Chain, went live.
