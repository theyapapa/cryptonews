Decentralized liquidity network Bancor has launched a wallet for on-chain conversions between Ethereum (ETH) and Eos (EOS) tokens, according to a press release shared with Cointelegraph on March 12.

The new product, Bancor Wallet, is a non-custodial crypto wallet that is designed to enable on-chain crypto conversions between Ethereum and Eos-based tokens “in a single action,” the press release reports.

The new wallet is based on Bancor’s recently launched cross-chain protocol BancorX, which allows users to convert between Ethereum and EOS-based tokens without exchanges.

Nate Hindman, Bancor's director of communications, told Cointelegraph in a statement that the release of Bancor’s unified wallet is expected to pave the way for the integration of other blockchains, giving Bitcoin (BTC) and Tron (TRON) as examples.

According to the press release, Bancor Wallet offers instant and zero-fee transactions between 9,700 token pairs, ensuring that any token in the network can be converted into any other at all times, regardless of available buyers or sellers.

The announcements also outlines that Bancor Wallet’s launch follows recent news that the Bancor protocol will be integrated into Samsung’s new Galaxy S10 smartphone via social gaming platform Enjin.

Back in 2007, Enjin partnered with Bancor to use smart tokens across the Enjin Coin platform and to enable Enjin Coin (ENJ) token’s compatibility with the Bancor protocol and network.
