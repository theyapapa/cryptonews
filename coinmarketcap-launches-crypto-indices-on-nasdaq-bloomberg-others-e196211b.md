###### 2019-03-20 11:03

Per the announcement, the indices will cover the top 200 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, one including Bitcoin (BTC) and one without it.

The latter benchmark will be called CMC Crypto 200 ex BTC Index (CMC200EX), while the one including Bitcoin is called CMC Crypto 200 Index (CMC200).

According to the post, Solactive is also the company behind the CBOE Bitcoin Futures index, which was launched in December 2017, and administers over three thousand custom indices.

Solactive’s head of sales, Fabian Colin, is quoted in the announcement as stating that access to CoinMarketCap’s data grants them the ability to develop custom indices for customers.

As Cointelegraph reported in mid-February, Nasdaq launched two new indices tracking the “spot or reference rate for the price” of Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH).

The indices were created by crypto asset market data company Brave New Coin.

Previously, in November last year, investment management firm VanEck's subsidiary MV Index Solutions launched its own Bitcoin index based on three major over-the-counter (OTC) desks.
