Russian mining and smelting giant Nornickel is planning to roll out a digital platform for metals trading by the end of 2019, local news outlet TASS reported on July 9.

The vice-president of Nornickel, Andrey Bugrov told TASS that “the preparation process was quite lengthy, but nevertheless, we plan to bring this product \[digitization of metal trading\] to the market by the end of 2019 and begin trading our tokens."

Bugrov also said that the token trading program could be worth nearly $1 billion, but that is rather a target figure.

In March, Russian billionaire and CEO of Nornikel Vladimir Potanin revealed plans to deploy cryptocurrency tokens for trading palladium through a Switzerland-based palladium fund, and to launch several digital platforms.

Trading valuable metals with tokens will purportedly enable more fluid transactions, wherein participants can sell excess volumes to third parties more easily than with traditional contracts.

Last month, Nornickel entered a partnership with tech giant IBM to launch an educational program for specialists to develop digital technologies for the mining and metals industry.

Recently, Austrian steel trading company Alukönigstahl announced that it is working on a blockchain-based steel trading data system dubbed “Steel but Smart.”
