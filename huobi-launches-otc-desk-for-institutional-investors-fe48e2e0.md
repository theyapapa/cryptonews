# Huobi Launches OTC Desk for Institutional Investors ...

Major global crypto exchange Huobi has launched a regulated over-the-counter (OTC) trading desk for institutional investors, according to a blog post on May 15.

The new OTC crypto trading platform, Huobi OTC Desk, is fully regulated by the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission (FSC), and enables major fiat-to-crypto and crypto-to-crypto trading pairs.

Unlike the existing Huobi’s OTC retail products, the new OTC trading desk enables a principal OTC trading process under Huobi Technology, Huobi’s regulated OTC trading entity in Gibraltar, while the existing OTC offering on otc.hbg.com enables peer-to-peer (P2P) tradings under Huobi Global, the firm clarified.

Jeff Adams, Senior Sales Manager for Huobi Global, stated that the launch of Huobi OTC Desk was driven by demand from investors for large volume transactions, claiming that the company has seen an “unfilled need” for such services.

According to the announcement, Huobi OTC Desk supports major cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), as well as fiat currencies including the United States dollar (USD), euro (EUR), and British pound sterling (GBP).

The launch of Huobi’s regulated OTC Desk follows the firm’s acquisition of a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) license from the Gibraltar FSC in late 2018, which enabled the exchange to attract institutional investors.

The desk offers OTC transactions in bitcoin, ether, eos (EOS), major stablecoin tether (USDT), Huobi Token (HT), as well as ripple (XRP), which was listed in March 2019.
