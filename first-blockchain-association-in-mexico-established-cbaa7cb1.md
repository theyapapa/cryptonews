In September, a group of U.S.-based blockchain and crypto companies, including crypto exchange Coinbase, announced establishment of the Blockchain Association based in Washington D.C.

The association is set to represent mainstream companies that look to operate within the political system, primarily addressing policy issues and the treatment of cryptocurrency by U.S. tax law.
