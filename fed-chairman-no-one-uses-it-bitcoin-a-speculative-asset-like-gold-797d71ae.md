# Fed Chairman: ‘No One Uses It’ — Bitcoin a Speculative Asset Like Gold ...

The Chairman of the United States Federal Reserve has said that a globally adopted cryptocurrency system could conceivably remove the need for reserve currencies.

Testifying before the Senate Banking Committee on July 11, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell gave his analysis of whether a cryptocurrency system with global prevalence could diminish — or even go so far as to remove the need for — so-called anchor currencies.

With the U.S. dollar de facto the world’s dominant reserve currency, Powell acknowledged the possibility of a preeminent cryptocurrency redrawing the current financial landscape — yet noted that as of yet, this has stopped short of becoming a reality.

The Fed chairman said:

“I think things like that \[the obsolescence of today’s reserve currencies\] are possible but we really \[…\] haven’t seen widespread adoption.

Powell’s comparison is noteworthy given the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s role as a custodian for the gold held by entities such as the U.S. and foreign governments, other central banks, and official international organizations.

Powell acknowledged that the prospect of cryptocurrencies coming to replace reserve currencies has been implied since their inception and that its realization could see the global financial system — and specifically the Federal Reserve System — profoundly transformed.

As reported, Powell had testified before the House Financial Services Committee earlier this week and acknowledged that the impact of Facebook’s forthcoming stablecoin Libra could be of a “potentially systemic scale” for the global financial and regulatory landscape.
