The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) and Hyperledger announced October 1 they would join each other’s organizations as “Associate Members” in order to support enterprise blockchain adoption.

The EEA, an enterprise blockchain organization created in March 2017 by Santander, JPMorgan, and a variety of other members, focuses on improving the privacy, scalability, and security of Ethereum (ETH) blockchain applications.

Brian Behlendorf, Executive Director of Hyperledger at the Linux Foundation and Ron Resnick, Executive Director of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, explained the impetus for the decision to join together in a blog post:

“This will enable more active and mutual cross-community collaboration through event participation, connecting with other members, and finding ways for our respective efforts to be complementary and compatible.”

Hyperledger’s Fabric technology has found its way into a raft of enterprise blockchain-based integrations in various sectors of the global economy.

At the end of September, FedEx joined Hyperledger, which has over 270 members, in order to look into blockchain use for supply chains, logistics, and transportation.

“Down the road, we hope this mutually beneficial relationship will encourage Ethereum developers to consider submitting their enterprise projects to Hyperledger and Hyperledger project maintainers to consider taking de-facto interfaces appropriate for standardization to the appropriate EEA working groups,” Behlendorf and Resnick continued, adding:

“This relationship will also enable Hyperledger developers to write code that conforms to the EEA specification and certify them through EEA certification testing programs expected to launch in the second half of 2019.”

In May, the EEA had released both a new software stack to standardize the specifications for Ethereum-based business applications, and the Enterprise Ethereum Client Specification 1.0, which will enable interoperability for companies that use Ethereum blockchain-based solutions.
