# Bittrex Crypto Exchange Transitions to ERC-20 Implementation of Tether ...

###### 2019-08-05 16:08

American cryptocurrency exchange Bittrex has completed switching Tether (USDT) from the OMNI-based implementation of the stablecoin to the ERC-20 standard on the Ethereum network.

Bittrex announced that USDT deposits and withdrawals are now open in a tweet on Aug. 5.

The exchange had temporarily suspended USDT deposits and withdrawals while making the switch.

With the move, Bittrex is looking to provide its users with faster, cheaper and more inter-operable transfers of USDT.

The announcement further explains:

“Once the swap is complete, all USDT from Omni network addresses can no longer be sent to Bittrex, and USDT from Bittrex accounts cannot be sent to Omni network addresses.”

Bittrex also notes that it will re-enable the USDT wallet once both the exchange and the Tether team come to an agreement that the migration is satisfactory.

In mid-July, Huobi cryptocurrency exchange announced it will transition its HUSD token from its current stablecoin system to an ERC-20 standard through a partnership with crypto startup Stable Universal Limited and Paxos Trust Company.
