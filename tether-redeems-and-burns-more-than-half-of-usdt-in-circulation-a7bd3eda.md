# Tether Redeems and ‘Burns’ More than Half of USDT in Circulation ...

Tether’s announcement directs the public to consult the “conceptual” outlines of the token issuance and redemption process as described in its white paper, where the firm states that:

“every tether issued or redeemed, as publicly recorded by the Bitcoin blockchain will correspond to a deposit or withdrawal of funds from the \[company’s\] bank account.”

As the white paper notes, for the crypto side of its accounting processes, the public and transparent nature of the public Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain — onto which tethers are issued via Omni Layer’s protocol — ensures that the token transaction can be verified and tracked.

Omni Explorer further indicates that Tether’s token reserves are now 466,678,763.48, congruous with the company’s statement.

When it comes to its fiat accounting, the white paper states that, as part of “the ‘Solvency Equation’ for the Tether System \[…\] the provability of \[U.S. dollar reserves\] will rely on several processes,” including the firm’s publication of bank account balances on its Transparency page (“Proof of Funds”), and professional audits.

After the firm is alleged to have dissolved its relationship with a third-party auditor this January, its “Proof of Funds” released in June claimed that Tether did have sufficient dollar reserves for circulating tokens, held in an undisclosed bank.

Today’s large-scale token redemption and destruction has provoked heated speculation on crypto Twitter, notably as tether had just recently — if briefly — lost its U.S. dollar peg to trade as low as $0.91, leading some to accuse the firm of manipulating the market by redeeming at low cost and liquidating after the market rebound.

Others have suggested that the company is unable to back the tokens with adequate reserves, alluding both to Tether’s troubled transparency history, the protracted crypto bear market, and the fact that associated crypto Bitfinex has recently been plagued by rumored insolvency and alleged banking difficulties, which it has since been prompted to officially deny.
