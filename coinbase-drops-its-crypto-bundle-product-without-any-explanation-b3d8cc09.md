# Coinbase Drops Its Crypto Bundle Product Without Any Explanation ...

###### 2019-07-19 05:07

Major United States-based crypto exchange Coinbase has discontinued its Coinbase Bundle crypto investment offering, the platform’s updated FAQ site reveals.

## Coinbase Bundle product is no more

Reasons for discontinuation of the product — which had only just launched in fall 2018 — have not been officially provided, with the exchange simply notifying users that:

“Coinbase Bundle purchases have been deprecated, as such all assets purchased in the Coinbase Bundle have been redistributed to their respective individual asset wallets.”

In a further comment, Coinbase says that while users will no longer see a standalone wallet for their Coinbase Bundle purchases, the amount of cryptocurrencies purchased as part of the package will not have changed and is thus “a cosmetic-only change.”

Coinbase Bundles has been designed to purportedly simplify cryptocurrency trading and draw new investors into the sector.

Each bundle was a basket of five cryptocurrencies — Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ether (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and Ethereum Classic (ETC) — supported on Coinbase and purchased in proportion to their market capitalization in USD.

## A changing crypto landscape

Earlier this week, Coinbase released aggregated data in the form of three trading signals designed to offer investment insights for its customers: top holder activity, typical hold time and popularity, and price correlation.

Other U.S.-based crypto trading platforms have similarly launched investment vehicles designed to streamline trading, such as the Winklevoss Twins’ Gemini exchange, which offers a “Cryptoverse” product tied to a basket of cryptocurrencies weighted by market cap to be bought as a single order.
