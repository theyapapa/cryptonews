###### 2019-05-05 23:05

Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Christian Catalini is on leave and working on the development of Facebook coin, cryptocurrency news Coindesk reported on May 3.

Per the report, two anonymous sources with knowledge of the situation told Coindesk about Catalini’s collaboration with Facebook.

Earlier this week, news broke that social media giant Facebook is reportedly seeking investments worth $1 billion for its bespoke cryptocurrency.

Reports first surfaced in May of last year that Facebook was “exploring” the creation of its own token.

Then, in February, a New York Times report stated that Facebook is “hoping to succeed where Bitcoin failed” with its highly secretive cryptocurrency project.

At press time, both Facebook and Catalini have not responded to Cointelegraph’s request for comment on the reported development.

In April, Cointelegraph released an analysis of the participation — both rumored and confirmed — of internet giants Facebook, Twitter and Telegram in the cryptocurrency space.
