On Jan. 7, activists of the French grassroots political movement the Gilets Jaunes — Yellow Vests — announced a bank run via social media, essentially hoping to meet their goals by destabilizing the local financial system.

## Brief introduction to the Yellow Vests movement and their bank run plan

The Yellow Vests movement started in November 2018, when various posts on social media suggested blocking roads and using yellow, high-visibility vests as a symbol of solidarity and support (hence the name).

Moreover, for the 10th anniversary of the Bitcoin genesis block, French graffiti artist Pascal Boyart unveiled his wall mural titled “La liberté guidant le peuple 2019,” based on Eugene Delacroix’s famous painting of the French Revolution, but featuring people in yellow vests.

As the French magazine Capital states, the potential disruptive element of the upcoming bank run could technically be considerable: When banks start to collapse due to their inability to cover the costs of operating, the whole sector is likely to fail altogether.

Still, fiat bank runs have contributed to the appeal of Bitcoin before, with Cyprus’s financial crisis in 2013 appearing to boost the price of the cryptocurrency.

According to a report by the largest French bank, BNP Paribas, the impact of the Yellow Vests’ movement on the French economy could be significant, but temporary.

Thus, one can only speculate about the effects a French bank run could have on the crypto market and whether cryptocurrencies could also streamline the protest.
