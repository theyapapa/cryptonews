Cryptocurrency payments startup Pundi X announced that it has integrated its crypto payments system into a device made by American Point of Sale (POS) systems producer VeriFone in a press release July 12.

Per the release, the startup has integrated its XPOS crypto payments module on the X990 Android-based POS terminal by VeriFone, which is reportedly one of the world’s major producers of such devices.

The initiative aims to allow a wider network of retailers to accept payments in cryptocurrencies.

The startup states:

“With this integration, shops and retail outlets using the VeriFone X990 with XPOS module activated will now be able to process cryptocurrency payments alongside traditional transactions.”

The XPOS-enabled devices will support payments in Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), KuCoin Shares (KCS), Kyber Network (KNC), Nem (XEM), and Pundi X (NPXS).

According to the press release, VeriFone has over 35 million devices in more than 150 countries.

In June last year, Pundi X began rolling out its cryptocurrency POS devices in Indonesia, betting that the central bank would discard its anti-cryptocurrency stance within three years.
