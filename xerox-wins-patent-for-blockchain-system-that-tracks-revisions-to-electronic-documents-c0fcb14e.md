The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has awarded Xerox a patent for a blockchain-driven auditing system for electronic files, according to a patent filing published Nov. 13.

The patent describes a blockchain-based system for the secure recording of revisions made to electronic documents.

The technology offered by Xerox can supposedly detect whether a file has been altered and tracks the history of changes made.

Explaining the technology behind the patent, Xerox describes a series of blockchain nodes that may approve or dismiss each amendment made.

Xerox believes that the newly patented technology can be used to audit electronic files in many areas, such as medical and financial records, tax papers, and educational documents.

Major tech and electronics companies have filed a slew of patent applications for various proprietary iterations and applications of blockchain technology.

IBM has filed over 90 blockchain patents, the most recent of which aims to use blockchain technology to aid scientific research and provide a record of its results.
