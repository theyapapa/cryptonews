The Government of Gibraltar in collaboration with the University of Gibraltar have created an advisory group focused on the development of blockchain-related educational courses, national news outlet the Gibraltar Chronicle reported Oct. 19.

The New Technologies in Education (NTiE) group is reportedly a joint initiative between the government, the University of Gibraltar, and a number of the leading technology firms based in the country.

Following the expansion of new technologies in Gibraltar, the NTiE will address the demand for related skills both in the private sector and at the governmental level.

“Providing access to innovative courses with expert input from those using this technology in the private sector is a vital component in the development of a sustainable distributed ledger technology (DLT) commercial community in Gibraltar,” stated Gilbert Licudi, a Queen’s Counsel and the minister with responsibility for the University of Gibraltar.

Within the initiative, the university will reportedly develop and enhance expertise in new technologies, including DLT, coding, and smart contracts, subsequently issuing a Professional Certificate of Competence within this area.

The government stated:

“The launch of the NTiE advisory group continues to build momentum for Gibraltar as a hub for new technologies, following the announcement in January 2018 that Gibraltar would be the first jurisdiction globally to introduce legislation around Distributed Ledger Technology.”

In September, New York University (NYU) through the NYU Stern School of Business became the “first” university in the U.S. to offer students a major in blockchain technology.
