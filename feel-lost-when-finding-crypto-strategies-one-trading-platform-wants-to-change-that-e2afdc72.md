As well as enabling users to trade some of the world’s top stocks — Netflix, Microsoft, Amazon and Apple among them — eToro also provides access to a wide range of cryptocurrencies.

Just like social networks that boast news feeds where friends and family post status updates, eToro enables users to write posts and share their opinions about the latest movements in crypto prices.

According to eToro, this enables its base to have an informed discussion about strategies and the steps required to build a strong portfolio.

Each eToro member has the ability to present the ratio of their successes and failures to the world — and receive a customized score that reflects the level of risk in their strategies.

## Copy that

One particularly novel feature of eToro is the CopyTrader feature, which enables users to emulate the strategies of those who have established a reputation for themselves on the platform.

From here, the platform says trades are copied automatically and in a transparent way — giving users the freedom to chop and change whenever they please.

Full statistics about past performance and the number of people who are following a particular trader’s strategy are given upfront in order to help a user make an informed decision.
