Major global crypto exchange Coinbase reportedly saw around $520 million in revenue last year, Reuters reported on April 18.

The publication calculated the sum by looking at a filing to Britain’s corporate registry last week showing Coinbase’s non-U.S. revenue equaled around 154 million euros ($173 million), noting that a Coinbase executive once stated that the non-U.S. revenue is equal to almost one third of the overall revenue

Based on Reuters’ calculations of Coinbase’s 2018 revenue, the crypto exchange has generated 60% less than its stated plans.

In late October 2018, Bloomberg published an article claiming that Coinbase had projected that it would see $1.3 billion in revenue in 2018.

Based on unspecified documents, Bloomberg wrote that the San Francisco-based crypto exchange foresaw significant revenue from commissions on trades, as well as from gains and losses in its crypto holdings, despite the bear market.

In January 2018, industry sources reported that Coinbase made about $1 billion in revenue in 2017, overshooting its forecast for that year by 66 percent.

Founded in 2012, Coinbase is a major crypto trading and wallet service based in the United States.

Coinbase Pro is currently ranked 43rd among global crypto trading markets by adjusted daily trading volume.
