# Israel National Economic Council Chair: BTC 'Intrinsically Inefficient, Will Disappear’ ...

Simhon argued that to issue Bitcoin at a national or global scale would cost “trillions of dollars of actual cost in energy,” as opposed to the existing state of affairs in which printing fiat money costs very little.

While intensely sceptical about Bitcoin, Simhon nonetheless delved into the hypothesis that some form of digital currency issuance could be acceptable to national governments.

He suggested that some governments might be willing to forfeit the profits they derive from virtually costless fiat currency issuance if the transition to digital currencies were deemed to be overall more efficient for the banking system.

“I am still quite confident that money as we know it will change,” he said — yet made it clear that this shift to digital currencies would not be due to the decentralized, anonymous peer-to-peer model of Bitcoin, but rather to a central-bank backed digital currency (CBDC).

Simhon noted that the Bank of Israel, the country’s central bank, had studied whether to pursue the issuance of digital shekels — Israel’s national fiat currency — and had decided against it.

Lastly, Simhon predicted that governments will remain staunchly opposed to anonymous digital currencies, citing concerns over their implication in the potential financing of terrorism.

As reported last November, International Monetary Fund (IMF) managing director Christine Lagarde has urged the international community to “consider” endorsing central bank-issued digital currencies, while remaining sceptical in regard to non-government-backed cryptocurrencies and assets.
