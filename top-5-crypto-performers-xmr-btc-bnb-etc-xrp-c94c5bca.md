# Top 5 Crypto Performers: XMR, BTC, BNB, ETC, XRP ...

###### 2019-07-07 11:07

Though bitcoin is the undisputed leader, it is unlikely that it will remain the only cryptocurrency that will see a sharp increase in price.

## XMR/USD

Monero (XMR) has risen by 8% in the past seven days and is the best performer among the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.

## BTC/USD

With the recovery in prices, bitcoin (BTC) bulls are getting confident again.

Though buying was seen below $10,000, as suggested by us in the previous analysis, failure of bulls to sustain highs of the week shows that traders stuck at higher levels are bailing out of their positions closer to $12,000.

If bears plummet the price below the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $9,965.48, the price can extend the correction to $8,727.40, which is the 50% retracement of the recent rally.

While most cryptocurrencies are still struggling well below their lifetime highs made in the previous bull market, the BNB/USD pair continues to trade close to its lifetime highs.

Any dip to strong support levels offers a low-risk buying opportunity to traders.
