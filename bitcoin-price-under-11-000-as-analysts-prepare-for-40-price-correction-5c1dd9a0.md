# Bitcoin Price Clings to $11,000 As Analysts Prepare For 40% Price Correction ...

###### 2019-07-01 04:07

Bitcoin (BTC) led major cryptocurrencies on a fresh downward spiral July 1 after markets halted support above $12,000.

Bullish forecasts for further growth also began appearing, with Fundstrat’s Tom Lee leading calls for a new all-time bitcoin price high in 2019.

Among them, data shows the supply of stablecoin tether (USDT) has doubled this year; increased tether issuance tends to result in both bitcoin price gains and volatility.

Josh Rager, the analyst and investor increasingly known for his bitcoin predictions on social media, added to the overall sentiment that the cryptocurrency was about to take a break from its bull run.
