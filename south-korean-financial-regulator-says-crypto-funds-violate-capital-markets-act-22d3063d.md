South Korea’s Financial Services Commission (FSC) has issued a statement to warn investors to be cautious while investing in cryptocurrency funds, according to documents published on the official FSC website on Oct. 24.

According to the FSC, investors might be misled by cryptocurrency funds, mistakenly believing that those public funds represent legal investing tools that comply with South Korea’s Capital Markets Act.

The Financial Services Commission further revealed its plans to hold consultations with relevant regulators in order to take action against crypto funds in a move to protect investors from risks of potential financial losses.

Earlier this month, FCS chairman Choi Jong-koo reiterated his negative stance towards digital currencies and Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) when speaking at a parliamentary audit session of the National Assembly commission.

South Korea’s financial authorities had banned all types of ICOs in September 2017, arguing that ICO token sales require too much monitoring and oversight.

On Oct. 2, a member of South Korea’s National Assembly called on the government to “open up the road” to ICOs by taking a softer stance in terms of regulations.

On Oct. 11, Cointelegraph reported that South Korea’s state authorities are “likely” to announce its official stance on ICOs in November.
