# EOS DApps Lose Almost $1 Million to Hackers Over the Last Five Months ...

Decentralized apps (DApps) based on the EOS blockchain have lost up to $1 million to hacks since July, Chinese crypto media Blockchain Truth reports Tuesday, Dec. 4.

According to the report, the DApps on EOS have seen 27 breaches from July to late November, losing up to 400,000 EOS, or 8 million yuan.

As of press time, the amount hacked was worth $800,000 according to the EOS price chart on CoinMarketCap.

Nonetheless, Guo Yonggang, an expert cited by Blockchain Truth, believes that most of the attacks on EOS DApps correlate with their vulnerabilities rather than with a bug in EOS itself.

Moreover, the report states that the EOS blockchain has a significant amount of dormant accounts — around 200,000 of 500,000 in total.

In addition, nearly 120,000 accounts are reportedly managed by groups, which means that 37 percent of the EOS blockchain is real active users.

As Cointelegraph reported in early December, the month has started with yet another debate around the EOS ecosystem, as Starteos — one of the official sanctioned nodes which can approve EOS transactions — appeared to publically offer its token holders financial rewards in return for their votes.
