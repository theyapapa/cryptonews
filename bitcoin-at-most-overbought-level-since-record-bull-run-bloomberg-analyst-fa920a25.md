Bitcoin (BTC) is at its most overbought level since its record highs in December 2017, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Mike McGlone claimed in an article published on April 5.

Per the report, Bitcoin’s GTI Global Strength Indicator shows that the coin has not been this overbought since its price neared its record peak of $20,000.

According to McGlone, recent market market growth occurred because of long-term price compression and low volatility, which caused the price to be “released from the cage.”

McGlone’s and Tawil’s analysis appear to contrast with that of Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder Thomas Lee.

Additionally, trade and author Peter Brandt seemingly disagreed with McGlone, having tweeted on April 5 that he wouldn't be surprised if Bitcoin was to enter another parabolic phase.

Earlier this week, leading United States derivative market CME Group pointed out that its Bitcoin futures reported record trading volumes on April 4.
