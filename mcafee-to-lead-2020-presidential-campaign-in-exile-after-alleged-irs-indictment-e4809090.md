United States entrepreneur and serial cryptocurrency advocate John McAfee has fled the country to conduct his 2020 presidential campaign, he said in a video statement Jan. 22.

McAfee claims he has been indicted by U.S. tax authorities and plans to run his campaign from a boat in international waters.

The controversial crypto community figure, who plans to run for president of the U.S. next year, said he had learned that a grand jury had been convened against him by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

While he said he did not know the exact nature of the allegations against him, McAfee added he had not paid taxes for the past eight years.

“I’ve made no secret of it; I’ve not filed returns,” he said in the first of several video blogs uploaded to Twitter on Tuesday, adding:

“The IRS has convened a grand jury in the state of Tennessee to charge myself, my wife \[...\] and four of my campaign workers with unspecified IRS crimes of a felonious nature.”

McAfee was speaking from a boat in an unknown location, reportedly in international waters, from where he said he would conduct the presidential campaign through the use of proxies on U.S. territory.

Last year, McAfee endorsed reportedly “unhackable” Bitcoin wallet Bitfi, similarly betting the online community no one could compromise it.
