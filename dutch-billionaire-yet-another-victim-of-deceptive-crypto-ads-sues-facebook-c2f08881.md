# Dutch Billionaire Yet Another Victim of Deceptive Crypto Ads, Sues Facebook ...

###### 2019-06-08 09:06

Earlier this week, Dutch billionaire John De Mol launched a lawsuit against Facebook over crypto ads using his image without permission.

The ban was “intentionally broad,” meaning that the social media company decided to ban all cryptocurrency ads on its platforms (namely Facebook, Instagram and Audience networks) first, and then learn how to select the ones that are actually “deceptive.”

Despite the extra measures from Facebook, it appears that fraud-related crypto ads still manage to find their way to the platform — as a result, the social media giant is now in the midst of a major lawsuit.

It is not the first time De Mol, who is affiliated with international TV hits including “The Voice,” "Deal or No Deal," "Fear Factor" and "Big Brother,” has brought up Facebook bitcoin ads that capitalize on his image.

According to court documents obtained by Cointelegraph, the ads featuring De Mol’s images promoted cryptocurrency scams on Facebook and Instagram, which allegedly damaged his reputation.

In response, Facebook lawyer Jens van den Brink reportedly stated that the social media company could not be forced to monitor all ads on its platforms at all times, and that Facebook had removed the De Mol-linked ads promptly after being informed about the complaints.

## De Mol is not the first celebrity to fight fake crypto ads in court

Evidently, De Mol is not the only celebrity who has been targeted by deceptive crypto-related ads on social media.
