# TRON CEO Says He Will ‘Rescue’ ETH and EOS Developers From Alleged ‘Collapse’ of Their Platforms ...

Decentralized internet protocol TRON CEO Justin Sun has said the company will build a fund to “rescue” Ethereum (ETH) and EOS developers from “the collapse” of their platforms, in a tweet, Dec. 6.

Sun made his offer with the precondition that the developers “migrate” their decentralized applications (dApps) to the Tron Foundation network.

This is not the first time Justin Sun has weighed in on his competitors in the industry on social media; in early October, the CEO claimed the Tron network’s latest version, Odyssey 3.1, could beat Ethereum on speed and EOS on cost.

Sun’s claims at the time prompted a surge of eight percent in the TRX token’s value.

In recent weeks, TRX — as ETH and EOS — has shed significant value amid volatile markets; the token, ranked 10th largest crypto on CoinMarketCap, is down 4.5 percent on the day, and 44 percent on the month, to trade at $0.013 at press time.

EOS, trading at $1.71 at press time, is down 21.2 percent on the day, 69 percent on the month.

In early November, decentralized liquidity network Bancor announced it had added support for EOS within its dApp for cross-blockchain token swaps.
