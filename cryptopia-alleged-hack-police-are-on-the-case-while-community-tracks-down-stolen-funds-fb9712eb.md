The exchange has also reportedly notified government agencies and authorities, including the New Zealand Police and High Tech Crimes Unit, who have opened an investigation into the matter and are reportedly treating the incident as a major crime.

According to local media outlet Stuff, on Jan. 16, the police locked down Cryptopia’s office in Christchurch while some of the staff remained inside.

While Cryptopia’s website is still under maintenance as of press time, the exchange has not revealed which tokens have been stolen and to what extent, limiting its comment to state that the losses are “significant.”

“At this stage I'd probably believe reports of $11 \[million\] + USD equivalent hack,” Reddit user u/spronky writes, “I wouldn't be surprised if all the ERC-20 tokens in Cryptopia's hot wallets were thieved \[sic\].”

In response to WhalePanda’s tweet, a couple of commentators have gone so far as to investigate Cryptopia’s recent transactions, claiming the exchange had moved Ethereum (ETH) worth several millions of dollars out of its wallet on Jan. 13, citing data from crypto exchange blockchain monitor Whale Alert.

That correlates with Cryptopia’s previous announcement regarding the Ethereum’s (ETH) Constantinople hard fork, when the exchange warned its users that it was placing ETH and all ERC-20 tokens into maintenance between Jan. 14 and Jan. 18.

On Jan. 16, after being tagged by a Twitter community member, Binance exchange CEO Changpeng Zhao said that he suspended “some” of the funds affiliated with Cryptopia after they ended up on his platform’s wallets and claimed that he will freeze more if social media users report them.
