# Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum, Litecoin, EOS, Bitcoin Cash, Tron, Stellar, Binance Coin, Bitcoin SV: Price Analysis, Feb. 8 ...

However, if the bulls defend the support zone and push prices above the moving averages and the downtrend line, it will indicate a possible reversal.

## LTC/USD

The bulls defended the support at the moving averages for the past two days and Litecoin (LTC) has surged higher today, reaching close to the overhead resistance of the downtrend line.

Conversely, if the bulls fail to sustain the higher level and the pair turns down, it can correct to the support at $33.

The short-term traders can stay on the long side on a close (UTC time frame) above the 20-day EMA, but they should aim for small targets and keep a tight stop.

Overhead, the 20-day EMA, $0.09285498, the downtrend line and the 50-day SMA will act as stiff resistances.

However, if the bulls succeed in carrying the XLM/USD pair above the 50-day SMA, a rally to $0.13427059 is likely.

## BSV/USD

Bitcoin SV had a large range day on Feb. 6 when it recovered from its intraday lows and ended marginally in the green.
