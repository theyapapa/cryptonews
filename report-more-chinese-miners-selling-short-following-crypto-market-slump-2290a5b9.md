# Report: More Chinese Miners Selling Short Following Crypto Market Slump ...

Chinese miners are reportedly becoming the biggest short sellers both locally and internationally, following an increased number of hedging operations in the current bear market, Chinese crypto outlet 8BTC reported Thursday, Dec. 6.

The severe cryptocurrency market decline in the last month has reportedly caused new generation miners to start hedging their coins to avoid market risks.

At the same time, frequent hedging operations make miners the biggest short sellers of Bitcoin (BTC), according to 8BTC.

Jin Xin, a Chinese miner who entered the industry in October 2017, reportedly said that the earnings from mining he made in the first two months are “much more” than the total profits he made in the past three years through other business.

Jin said:

“If I mine 30 tokens in the next month, while its price may continue to fall by another 10 percent according to the current trend, I shall place a short order on the exchange to sell them at current price but deliver one month later.”

Once the “shutdown price” is reached, Jin power down the equipment, removes GPU chips and sells them to game players.

As Cointelegraph reported in late November, cryptocurrency mining operators in China are reportedly selling mining equipment by weight, as opposed to price per unit, as the market slump had resulted in a large drop in mining profitability.
