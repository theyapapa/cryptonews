Binance has unveiled a series of new products and features relating to stablecoins — with the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange describing these digital assets as “an efficient fiat gateway into crypto.”

With new coins emerging all the time, the industry is evolving quickly, prompting the company to launch a stablecoin market in which its consumers can benefit from pairings with other cryptocurrencies.

As reported by Cointelegraph, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao has been vocal about his support for stablecoins, as he believes they offer “far more freedom than traditional fiat for users” and help regulators maintain control.

Binance asserts that “it is now often more efficient to buy cryptocurrency via stablecoins than through a fiat exchange” — not least because of how stablecoins are less susceptible to high transaction fees and market volatility.

There can also be advantages when cryptocurrencies are being changed back to fiat, as the use of stablecoins can help consumers avoid the higher withdrawal fees often levied by fiat-focused exchanges.

To help crypto enthusiasts make savings, Binance recommends that consumers convert their fiat into stablecoins by using the official websites of the five it supports — all of which have “straightforward, trusted channels” for helping the transactions run smoothly.
