# UAE Becomes World’s Biggest Contributor to Token Sales, Data Shows ...

###### 2019-04-29 10:04

The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has been the world’s biggest contributor to crypto token sales so far this year, according to data recently released by CoinSchedule.

While the United States has long dominated token sales, the data shows it has fallen to sixth place in terms of the funds raised since January.

U.S. investors have pledged $37.2 million to token sales — a fifth of their counterparts in the UAE.

The UAE’s surge in crypto investments has been sudden, as the state did not even feature in the top 10 countries for digital token sales in 2018.

According to Bloomberg, two big token sales have driven the UAE’s dominance in CoinSchedule’s rankings.

When it comes to the countries holding the most token sales, CoinSchedule’s data tells a different story.

The UAE has been seeking to become a leading destination for blockchain-related businesses by preparing new crypto legislation.
