United States blockchain advocacy group the Chamber of Digital Commerce has encouraged two major financial regulators to foster blockchain innovation, according to an official tweet on Feb. 19.

The group has reportedly provided comments to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) in different proceedings this week.

Generally, the Chamber has asked both agencies to permit the introduction of new financial products based on blockchain technologies and to collaborate on efficient approaches that would promote investment and industry growth.

In its comments to the CFPB, the advocacy group has encouraged the regulator to apply available tools for supporting innovation, such as no-action letters and so-called “sandboxes.”

In a separate letter to the CFTC, the group expressed support for the Commission’s previously launched initiative, dubbed LabCFTC, which examines fintech innovations.

Moreover, the Chamber endorsed the CFTC’s commitment to learn more about the Ethereum (ETH) network, as well as the possibility to elaborate a framework for the introduction of ETH derivatives.

Earlier this year, the Chamber of Digital Commerce called on the U.S. government to implement a national action plan on blockchain.
