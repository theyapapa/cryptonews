# Tor Digital Privacy Project Accepts Donations in Cryptocurrency ...

###### 2019-03-24 11:03

Tor digital privacy software is now accepting donations in various cryptocurrencies, as a new crypto donational portal appeared on the project’s website on March 18.

Tor’s crypto donation page encourages users to “stand up for the universal human rights to privacy and freedom and help keep Tor robust and secure.”

The Tor Project is a non-profit that offers free and open-source software made for onion routing, the technology of anonymous information exchange.

The main purpose of using the Tor Browser is to remain anonymous and circumnavigate censorship by disguising an IP-address.

At press time, the Tor Project has not responded to Cointelegraph’s request for comment on the addition of crypto donations.

Earlier this month, the head of the Finance Committee of France’s National Assembly suggested a ban on anonymous cryptocurrencies, or so-called privacy coins, such as ZEC and XMR.

The Tor community and crypto community both share an ethos of privacy and decentralization.
