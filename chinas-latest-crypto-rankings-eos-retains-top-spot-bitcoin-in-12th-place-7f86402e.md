China updated its cryptocurrency rankings on May 23 — with eos retaining the top spot and bitcoin moving up three places.

The government-sponsored index assessed each blockchain on three criteria: technology, application and innovation.

Joining EOS in the top five was tron, ether, steem and ontology.

Despite its dominance in the crypto industry overall, Bitcoin was in 12th place.

The rankings were released by the Center for Information and Industry Development in collaboration with China’s Ministry for Industry and Information Technology.

Eos has held the top spot since June 2018, while tron has managed to stay in second place since February 2019.

Meanwhile, China’s e-commerce site JD.com has applied for more than 200 blockchain patents.
