## Emotional traders’ most common mistakes

Here are some common mistakes that emotional traders make: over trading, trading impulsively, revenge trading, missing trade after trade, hesitating, chasing the market, entering late, taking premature profits, moving stops too close to the market or too far away from the market, breaking their rules or blowing up their accounts.

## Acknowledge fear vs. greed

Fear and greed are the two most common emotions that traders experience, and these account for most of the poor decisions that lose them money.

Fear is often caused by trading with too much size, compounding the consequences of a bad decision.

The downside to greed is that it causes traders to “chase the market,” or FOMO into bad positions.

Set achievable goals and incorporate daily activities (studying markets, reading financial news, paper trading, etc.) to keep your emotions at bay.

The more often you check to see how your trade is doing, the more likely you are to make an emotional decision to either exit too early or move your stop loss.

## Trade with the proper size

Nothing causes more fear than trading with too much size.
