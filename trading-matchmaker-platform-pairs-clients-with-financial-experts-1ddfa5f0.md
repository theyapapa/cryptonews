The Taiwan-based Bincentive project, an innovative crypto trader service provider in Asia, developed the idea of matching their clients with trading experts.

On Bincentive’s platforms, clients are matched with trading experts and can follow an experts’ actions in crypto markets.

“This innovative platform allows individual members (investment clients) to connect with financial experts, introduces profit sharing, and creates a bridge from crypto assets to all financial products,” reads the project’s whitepaper.

The Bincentive platform aims to provide professional financial services from traditional trading experts, quantitative traders, and AI trading engines, via Quasi Decentralized Apps (Q-DApps).

“Using blockchain and smart contract technology, trading experts can safely and conveniently present their trading strategies, allowing investment customers to simply choose the trading services that best fit their needs”, the white paper notes.

On October 20, 2018, Bincentive held HatchQ’s launch event with several notable experts in crypto trading in attendance: Andy Cheung, COO of OKEx and his team, Tiantian Kullander, Co-founder of Amber AI, Simon Chang, former Asia CIO of Jefferies, Chaoming Cho, CEO of Bincentive and experienced trading professionals Nicholas Yang, CEO of Bitbitduo and Hank Huang, founder of Coinful.

The HatchQ race will run for six weeks, and the top three strategists, selected by professional trading experts, will receive premium cash prizes and trading fund sponsorship to officially operate on the Bincentive platform as partners.
