A Chinese survey of 4,200 respondents has shown that 40 percent are willing to invest in crypto in the future, local Chinese crypto news outlet 8btc reports on Dec. 26.

PANews, whose Twitter describes the outlet a news source for sharing blockchain news across Asia, conducted the survey.

According to the answers gathered during the crypto-related survey, about half of all the respondents had heard of the following terms: cryptocurrency, digital currency or Bitcoin (BTC).

On the other hand, 63 percent of the respondents believe that there is no necessity for crypto as a means of payment.

The Chinese government recently released its latest ranking of cryptocurrencies, which places Bitcoin in 18th place and EOS at the top.

As Cointelegraph reported in mid-November, a Twitter survey conducted by former United States congressman Ron Paul — which counted 94,894 votes — favor Bitcoin over more traditional forms of money as a long-term investment.

Also, a more recent survey conducted by the German Federal Association for Information Technology, Telecommunications and New Media (Bitkom) revealed that over-one third of big German businesses consider blockchain as revolutionary as the internet.
