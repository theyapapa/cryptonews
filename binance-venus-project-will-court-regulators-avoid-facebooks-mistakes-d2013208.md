###### 2019-08-30 07:08

Cryptocurrency exchange Binance has said that it will learn from the regulatory issues that have plagued Facebook’s proposed Libra digital currency.

In an interview, Aug 29, Binance co-founder He Yi claimed that the company will engage with regulators from day one regarding its Venus stablecoin project.

## Learning from the mistakes of others

Since Facebook announced its Libra stablecoin project back in June, it has faced tough scrutiny from regulatory bodies worldwide.

As Cointelegraph reported last week, the Venus project will focus on creating localized stablecoins around the world.

He said that Venus drew inspiration from Libra, but would take a more conservative approach, with a priority on regulatory compliance.

## Belt and Road stablecoins

Another aspect in which Venus will differ from Libra, is Binance’s focus on partnering with governments and companies in non-Western countries.

He especially referenced China, when she called Venus a “Belt and Road” version of Libra.
