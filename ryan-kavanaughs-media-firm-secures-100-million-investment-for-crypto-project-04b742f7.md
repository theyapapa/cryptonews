United States-based film producer Ryan Kavanaugh’s Proxima Media has unveiled a $100 million investment for a cryptocurrency-based film funding tool, entertainment industry news outlet TheWrap reported on May 23.

Per the report, Proxima Media — which Kavanaugh founded and owns — announced plans for a new crypto-enabled financing tool for film, TV, music and other intellectual property-driven content dubbed Proxicoin.

Proxima reportedly received the investment from garment production company Central Wealth Group and venture capital fund Step Ventures.

Furthermore, TheWrap claims that Proxicoin holders will also be partial owners of a new exchange for financing entertainment projects called Entertainment Stock X (ESX).

Kavanaugh commented on the initiative:

“This exchange will give ordinary consumers worldwide access to investments in their favorite movies, something they love, in a way that was previously only available to a limited few.”

As Cointelegraph reported in October last year, U.S. actor and producer Johnny Depp is partnered with crypto-powered social entertainment platform TaTaTu.

In November 2018, Dutch rights management company Fintage House has signed a deal with blockchain-based social entertainment platform TaTaTu to start accepting cryptocurrency for rights transactions.
