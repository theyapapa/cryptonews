## BTC/USD

Contrary to our opinion, the pullback in Bitcoin did not even reach the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement level of $4,712.89.

A breakdown of the year-to-date lows is likely to attract further selling, dragging the BTC/USD pair to $3,000 levels.

The bears will try to breakdown the recent lows of $0.13427050 and plunge the XLM/USD pair to $0.08 levels.

If the bears break the support and make a new year-to-date low, the drop can extend to $0.025954 levels.

A break below the $53 levels will resume the downtrend and can plunge the XMR/USD pair to the next support at $40.

The trend remains down and the bears have successfully defended the first resistance level, which shows that the sellers are in command.

On the other hand, if the bulls manage to hold prices above the Nov. 25 intraday low, the digital currency might enter a consolidation.
