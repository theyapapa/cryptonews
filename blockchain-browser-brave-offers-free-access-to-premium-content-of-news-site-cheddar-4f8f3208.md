Blockchain-enabled web browser Brave has partnered with news website Cheddar to offer its users three months of free access to premium content, a press release reports Jan. 29.

According to the press release, Brave Browser users will automatically obtain access to premium content on Cheddar’s website, without action on the user’s end.

Jon Steinberg, founder and CEO of Cheddar, said that “the idea of unlocking our premium feeds for Brave users via crypto funding, with no sign-up, seemed like a natural way to engage a passionate community.”

The Brave browser is an open-source, pay-to-surf browser based on Chromium that blocks ads and website trackers.

The press release reports that Brave browser has 5.5 million monthly active users on its desktop and mobile versions.

As Cointelegraph reported in December last year, Brave is now the default browser on Exodus, “the first native blockchain phone,” produced by major smartphone manufacturer HTC.

News broke in September 2018 that Brave filed privacy complaints in Ireland and Britain against Google for user data practices.
