# Life of Luxury: Fashion Turns to Blockchain ...

###### 2019-06-08 12:06

Although once confined largely to agriculture, blockchain technology is now making major inroads into the luxury goods supply chain market.

As customers become more and more concerned with the ethical origins of their products and companies seek to create sustainable and profitable business models, blockchain technology is increasingly being seen as a solution to suit all parties involved.

Although Louis Vuitton’s relationship with blockchain reportedly spans three years to date, other luxury brands are already experimenting with the technology to help streamline their supply chains.

Alyx, a luxury brand created by New York-based creative director Matthew Williams, is pairing up with the German blockchain foundation Iota in order to create a more ethically transparent supply chain.

Nadia Hewett, lead for blockchain and distributed ledger technology (DLT) at the World Economic Forum, explained that traceability and streamlining present real benefits for companies with complex supply chain structures:

“Currently, the supply chain industry is fragmented, with parties adopting a siloed approach.

Hewett added that blockchain technology presents unique advantages for large, multinational companies seeking to both streamline and tighten security over their supply chains:

“A blockchain-based platform can support the digitization of paper-based documentation, and establish an immutable, shared record of all transactions among network participants in near real time.

Sumedha Deshmukh, a project specialist for blockchain and DLT at the World Economic Forum, said that their current blockchain projects witness collaboration efforts from a diverse range of industries and sectors:

“We have assembled organizations from across all supply chain functions, cutting edge blockchain companies and key members of civil society in our project community.
