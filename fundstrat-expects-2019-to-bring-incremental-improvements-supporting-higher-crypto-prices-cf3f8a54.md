The analysts describe incremental improvements that will purportedly support higher prices for cryptocurrencies.

Fundstrat believes it is still too early to talk about mass adoption, but notes that cryptocurrency prices will likely see a visible recovery:

“Is 2019 the mainstream breakout year?

But that is not necessary for crypto prices to eventually bottom in 2019, and by the end of 2019, we expect prices to be staging a visible recovery.”

At a macro level, the report names the expected weakening of the United States dollar as a first reason behind Bitcoin (BTC) price recovery.

Fundstrat’s analysts also believe that emerging market equities will outperform U.S. stocks and bonds, thus creating a friendly environment for crypto.

The outlook further states that much anticipated institutional investments will also increase in 2019 due to the developments in custody solutions and over-the-counter (OTC) trading, thus contributing to the crypto price recovery.

Moreover, Fundstrat mentions that the overall interest in crypto might be stimulated by Binance’s recent decision to support credit card crypto purchases, along with the rumors that major companies like Bitfury and Bitmain might consider conducting initial public offerings (IPO).
