President Donald Trump voiced his opposition to cryptocurrencies as a whole, Bitcoin and Libra specifically in a series of tweets around 8:15 p.m. EST on July 11.

The full text of the three tweets reads:

“I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air.

Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity....

“...Similarly, Facebook Libra’s ‘virtual currency’ will have little standing or dependability.

If Facebook and other companies want to become a bank, they must seek a new Banking Charter and become subject to all Banking Regulations, just like other Banks, both National…

“...and International.

It is by far the most dominant currency anywhere in the World, and it will always stay that way.

What prompted President Trump to issue these tweets is a matter for speculation, but presumably has something to do with the impending congressional hearings on Project Libra scheduled for next Tuesday and Wednesday, July 16 and July 17.

Likewise, the intended result of these tweets in terms of policy or practice remains uncertain.
