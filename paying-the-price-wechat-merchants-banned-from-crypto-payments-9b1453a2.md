On May 7, Dovey Wan, founding partner of crypto investment firm Primitive Ventures tweeted that the Chinese social media behemoth and payment service provider WeChat is set to ban merchants from making cryptocurrency payments.

This ban marks the latest effort to stymie cryptocurrency usage in China, with the government also mulling over ways of greatly decreasing the presence of crypto mining on its soil.

## WeChat bans crypto payments

A rough translation of the Payment Service Protocol found on weixin.qq.com indicates that the ban is a result of changes regarding payment management and measures to ensure “the prevention of illegal telecommunications networks and criminal matters,” brought about by the People’s Bank of China.

Commenting on the country’s legal stance on cryptocurrency and mining, Tapscott added:

“It’s not really necessary to do that \[to ban exchanges and mining\] because in 20 years we are not going to be using bitcoin in China.

## China ponders mining ban

A Reuters report published on April 9 revealed that the Chinese government is considering placing a ban on crypto mining.

Although prospects for the crypto market may well appear grim in the event that the ban would take effect, D’Aria explained that the bitcoin blockchain will recover in the long run:

“It's yet another example of how resilient Bitcoin actually is — it can be disrupted in the short term, but long term it adjusts to compensate.”

News about Alipay’s decision to block a number of accounts soon spread to the crypto community, with Red Li, co-founder of the Chinese crypto community 8BTC tweeting a screenshot of the announcement from Alipay, stating that “#alipay is blocking accounts involved in bitcoin otc trading.”
