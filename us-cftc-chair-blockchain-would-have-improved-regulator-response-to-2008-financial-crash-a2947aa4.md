United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo says that blockchain technology would have allowed for a “far faster, better-informed, and more calibrated regulatory intervention” in response to the 2008 financial crisis.

Giancarlo made his remarks during a speech — entitled “The New Futurism: 21st Century Financial Markets, Technology and Regulation” — which was delivered at the Commissione Nazionale per le Societa e la Borsa (CONSOB) in Rome, Italy on June 3.

Giancarlo devoted the first part of his speech to reflections on blockchain and the 2008 financial crisis — both in regard to the latter’s unfolding and aftermath.

In his comments, Giancarlo said that had regulators had access to blockchain-powered real-time trading ledgers of large Wall Street banks, they would have been spared the complex and cumbersome task of having to “assemble piecemeal data to recreate complex, individual trading portfolios” — with major implications for their handling of the crisis.

He continued:

“What a difference it would have made a decade ago if blockchain technology on a private distributed ledger accessible to regulators had been the informational foundation of Wall Street’s derivatives exposures.

2008 regulators, the chairman underscored, would have significantly benefited from access to real-time distributed ledgers (DLT).

Giancarlo also predicted that blockchain will have a “broad and lasting impact” across a range of applications, among them “payments, banking, securities settlement, title recording, cyber security and trade reporting and analysis.”
