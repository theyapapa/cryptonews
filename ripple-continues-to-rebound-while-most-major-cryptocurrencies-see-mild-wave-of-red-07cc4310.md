Recently, CoinShares CSO Meltem Demirors argued that one of the reasons the market has been seeing volatility this week was that institutions are “taking money off the table” in anticipation of Bitcoin Cash’s (BCH) recent hard fork.

The Bitcoin Cash hard fork took place on Nov. 15, the day after crypto markets have suffered a notable decline.

Bitcoin Cash is seeing some of the largest losses across top 20 coins at press time, down 4.29 percent, and trading around $385 at press time, according to CoinMarketCap.
