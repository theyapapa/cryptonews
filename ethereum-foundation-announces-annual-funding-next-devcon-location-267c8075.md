The Ethereum Foundation is planning to spend $30 million on different projects across the ecosystem over the next 12 months, the company’s executive director Aya Miyaguchi revealed at the ConsenSys’ Ethereal Summit on May 10.

In the course of the next year, the Foundation is going to allocate funds for improvement of Ethereum’s performance and security, which includes working on the current proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm of Ethereum 1.

Regarding specific projects, Miyaguchi revealed that the Foundation has decided to support MolochDAO, an experimental, decentralized system that seeks to provide funding for the Ethereum infrastructure.

Miyaguchi also announced that the next Ethereum Devcon, Devcon 5, will take place in Osaka, Japan from Oct. 8 –11.

Earlier today, the CEO of crypto analytics firm Messari Ryan Selkis forecasted that the Ethereum 2.0 proof-of-stake (PoS) transition will not take place until 2021.

Selkis forecasted that the PoW algorithm will be the status quo for “at least two or three years,” while the Ethereum PoS transition will “take a lot longer than anybody appreciates.”

x is “probably pretty good, and maybe even good enough.”
