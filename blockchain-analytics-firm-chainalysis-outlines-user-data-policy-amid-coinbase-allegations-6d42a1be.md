# Blockchain Analytics Firm Chainalysis Outlines User Data Policy Amid Coinbase Allegations ...

###### 2019-03-06 02:03

New York-based blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis has published an official statement clarifying that it does not collect or sell users’ personal data when it provides its services to cryptocurrency exchanges.

Chainalysis is one of the highest-profile firms in the blockchain intelligence industry, providing technology — such as its proprietary KYT (Know Your Transaction) tool — that enables firms, governments and law enforcement agencies to monitor blockchain transactions and track suspected illicit activities, such as money laundering or terrorist financing.

As reported, allegations that such firms may be circulating their clients’ user data surfaced last week in the midst of community backlash over Coinbase’s controversial acquisition of blockchain analytics firm Neutrino.

While the executive did not explicitly identify these intelligence firms by name, Chainalysis has evidently responded by clarifying that it does not require or store — let alone circulate — any personal data in order to conduct transaction analyses:

“Exchanges that use Chainalysis KYT \[...\] submit their transaction data — not personally identifiable customer data — to Chainalysis to automate the process of transaction monitoring.

As per the blog post, the firm’s blockchain analytics tools are thus aimed at monitoring service-level transaction data, not at labeling individual users’ wallets.

As reported yesterday, London-based blockchain analytics firm Elliptic — which provides technology to Coinbase — has refuted allegations that it collects and sells clients’ user data to third parties for financial gain.

Also yesterday, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong revealed that Neutrino staff with prior connections to the contentious software firm Hacking Team will transition out of their new roles at the exchange.
