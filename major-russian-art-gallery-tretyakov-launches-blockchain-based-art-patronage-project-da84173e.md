The prestigious State Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow, Russia, is launching a blockchain-based art patronage scheme, Russian news agency TASS reports Nov. 15.

The system, developed with business innovation collective RDI Digital, uses blockchain technology to assign and manage the patronage structure.

The system randomly selects which storage unit (electronic copy of an object of art) will be considered digitized using this cartridge, and links the name to the object.

A presentation of the My Tretyakov initiative will reportedly be held today at the Business venue of the VII Saint Petersburg International Cultural Forum, and is being pitched as “a new form of public involvement in art.”

As previously reported, the world’s ostensibly “first” cryptocurrency art auction as held at U.K. fine art gallery Dadiani Syndicate this June, involving the sale of fractional ownership of Andy Warhol’s 14 Small Electric Chairs – worth $5.6 million.

The auction made use of a blockchain platform developed by U.K. and Singapore-based startup Maecenas, which specializes in creating tamper-proof digital certificates linked to works of art on blockchain, which are then tradable on an exchange.

Blockchain has also been used in the art world to verify the provenance, copyright, ownership, valuation and authenticity of works.
