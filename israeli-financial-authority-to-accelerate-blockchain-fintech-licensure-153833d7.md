The Capital Market, Insurance and Saving Authority, a division of Israel’s Ministry of Finance (MoF), is looking to accelerate the process of procuring licenses for blockchain and fintech companies in the country.

According to the report, the authority has launched dedicated industry teams, some of which specialize in blockchain companies.

According to the report, the authority is hoping to foster local competition by licensing more fintech companies.

Additionally, preliminary research by the Israeli Securities Authority has shown that dozens of companies, at a minimum, could receive a work permit in Israel with minimal changes to their business models or technologies, per the report.

## Bitcoin advocates go after Israeli banks

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the nonprofit Israel Bitcoin Association has purportedly started a legal petition to make the Bank of Israel disclose local banks’ policies pertaining to crypto.

An unnamed cryptocurrency investor has also started a class action suit against the Israel Bank Hapoalim, since they would not accept money deposits that were generated via Bitcoin (BTC) investments.

The complainant’s lawyer, Lior Lahav, emphasized that this banking issue is a problem affecting tens of thousands of investors in the country:

“There are more than 70,000 bitcoin investors in Israel who are facing the same problem from their banks \[...\] 99 percent of them are ordinary people that invested in a thing that’s completely legal.”
