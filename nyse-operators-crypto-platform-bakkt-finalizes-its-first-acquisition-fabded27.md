# NYSE Operator’s Crypto Platform Bakkt Finalizes Its First Acquisition ...

###### 2019-02-09 12:02

Bakkt, the much-anticipated digital assets platform operated by the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), has closed its first acquisition, a tweet from the company revealed Feb. 8.

By acquiring certain assets in the company, Bakkt said it hopes:

“RCG’s remarkable heritage, culture and expertise will help us build out a trusted institutional infrastructure for digital assets.”

Bakkt had announced the acquisition of assets in RCG in mid-January.

During the hour-long call, ICE CFO Scott Hill mentioned Bakkt, saying the firm’s investment in the digital assets platform “will generate $20 million to $25 million of expense based upon the run rate in the first quarter.”

Later in the call, ICE’s chairman and CEO, Jeff Sprecher, called Bakkt a “moonshot bet.”

In late December, ICE reported it will update the launch of the Bakkt Bitcoin (USD) Daily Futures Contract launch timeline in early 2019, in accordance with the CFTC’s approval process.

More recently, Bakkt published a list of eight evidently new vacancies at the company, all of which are based in Atlanta and New York City.
