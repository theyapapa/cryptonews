# Crypto Company Offering Virtual ATMs Hits New Daily Highs — And Aims to Take on Square ...

Netcoins, which is aiming to simplify the process of buying and selling crypto by offering the public a trustworthy source for making purchases, says its performance has been strengthening — even despite the recent turbulence seen in the market.

Mark Binns, the company’s CEO, said, “Despite the bear crypto market that is upon us, Netcoins continues to grow the top line transactional revenue number.”

## Taking on payment giants

As transactions grow, and the number of retailers where crypto can be bought using Netcoins’ platform increases — with more than 171,000 locations around the world — it has a bold ambition: to mount a challenge against a giant player in the payment processing world.

Square is a payment processing company which only expanded into the crypto space at the beginning of 2018, after releasing an app that enables users to send money to friends and family for free.

Netcoins says that over-the-counter (OTC) services are another way that it aims to distinguish itself from Square and offer an attractive proposition for seasoned crypto holders, along with first-time investors.

Kennett added that, despite Netcoins’ much smaller market cap, it’s crypto net revenues are almost half that of Square’s: $240,517 against $500,000.

It is equally impressive that this growth is being achieved in the face of a crypto bear market, where companies such as Binance have publicly stated that their volumes are down approximately 90 percent over the peak from earlier this year,” he said.
