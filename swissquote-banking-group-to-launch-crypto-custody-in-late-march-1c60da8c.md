Swiss banking group Swissquote has revealed its plans to launch crypto custody services in late March, according to the company’s 2018 business results report, published on March 8.

According to the report, the company has been trading five major cryptocurrencies since 2017 and is now introducing a crypto custody service.

The solution will be based on services provided by fintech company Crypto Storage AG.

Crypto Storage AG is a Swiss startup that provides infrastructure to manage private keys.

As Cointelegraph previously reported, Swissquote started accepting Bitcoin (BTC) in mid-2017, following a similar decision by Swiss Falcon Private Bank.

This January, Falcon Private Bank has introduced support for direct transfers and storage of four major cryptocurrencies — Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, and Litecoin — in an attempt to make blockchain assets “fully bankable.”

Also in January, the country’s major private investment bank Vontobel has launched a crypto custody solution targeting banks and asset managers.
