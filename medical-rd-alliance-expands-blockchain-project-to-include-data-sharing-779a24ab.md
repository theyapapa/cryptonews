The Pistoia Alliance has expanded its blockchain project to include data sharing, data identity, and data integrity, according to a press release published on Feb 8.

The Pistoia Alliance was formed to help integrate new technology to assist in the companies’ respective research and development (R&D) fields.

Prior to its foray into blockchain-based data management, Pistoia concentrated on educating the medical industry on the emerging technology.

According to Pistoia, a recent survey found that access to skilled personnel and understanding of the technology are the primary barriers to blockchain’s adoption.

“Much of the industry is still at the ‘discussion’ stage of blockchain, we want to move beyond this and take action that actively supports members and leads to tangible outcomes that will benefit R&D, accelerate innovation and support the discovery of new treatments,” according to the president of the Pistoia Alliance, Steve Arlington.

Distributed ledger technology (DLT) has been implemented across the healthcare industry to make medical data more shareable and more secure.

That same month, the Austrian government offered financial support for a U.K. cancer research company, Lancor Scientific, that uses blockchain technology to detect the disease.
