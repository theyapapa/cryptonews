# India: Central Bank Report States Crypto Does Not Threaten Financial Stability ...

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has stated that cryptocurrencies currently pose no threat to financial stability in its recent financial report, published Dec. 28.

The document entitled “Report on Trend and Progress of Banking in India 2017-18” reads:

“\[C\]rypto-assets do not pose risks to global financial stability currently.

RBI quoted a conclusion drawn from a recent report by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) — an international agency consisting of banking and financial institutions from different countries, including India.

In its study “Crypto-asset markets: Potential channels for future financial stability implications,” published October, the FSB claimed that bankers see no significant danger in the existence of cryptocurrencies, as their total market cap by that time had barely reached 2 percent of the global value of gold.

The legal framework for cryptocurrencies in India remains unclear, as RBI formally stopped all banks from dealing with cryptocurrencies in April.

At the same time, an Indian government panel is reportedly considering a complete ban on crypto.

Initially, RBI had considered launching its own central bank digital currency, dubbed “Laxmi.”
