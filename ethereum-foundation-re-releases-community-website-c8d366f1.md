# Ethereum Foundation Re-Releases Community Website ...

###### 2019-05-03 14:05

The Ethereum Foundation has decided to release a new iteration of their community website ethereum.org, according to an official tweet on April 30.

According to an Ethereum Foundation blog post on the same day, ethereum.org is intended to be a repository of community-created Ethereum content, such as documentation and tutorials built by community members.

The Ethereum team goes on to say:

“This is a website for a community that is busy getting things done: on-boarding new developers and users, educating ourselves and each other, and building.”

The team, however, emphasizes that the website in its current state is merely a starting point; they expect the community to make improvements and additions.

As Cointelegraph previously reported, the Ethereum Foundation has partnered with Filecoin owner Protocol Labs to create a new Verifiable Delay Function (VDF) as of April.

The Ethereum Foundation also awards research grants via their Ethereum Foundation Grants Program that fund a variety of community-based Ethereum projects.

As Cointelegraph recently covered, Ethereum has awarded grants to researchers at Columbia and Yale who are compiling the smart contract language DeepSea into the Ethereum Virtual Machine.
