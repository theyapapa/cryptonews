Spanish automobile manufacturer SEAT has joined Alastria consortium to work on the development of blockchain-based products.

Founded in 1950, SEAT is a state-owned industrial company and Spain’s largest car manufacturer.

Per the recent announcement, SEAT joined Alastria, a multi-industry, semi-public consortium backed by a national network of more than 70 companies and establishments.

As part of the collaboration, SEAT plans to test the benefits of blockchain in the field of finance, aiming to improve and optimize the existing processes and facilitate supply chain management.

SEAT president Luca de Meo reportedly said that the company is “convinced of the relevance that blockchain technology will have in the future.”

In the meantime, SEAT and Telefónica have already begun jointly working on a proof-of-concept of a blockchain product that will track vehicle parts throughout the supply chain of SEAT’s factory located in Martorell, Spain.

In September, German automobile manufacturer Porsche AG announced that it will increase its investments in startups — with a focus on blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) — by around $176 million over the next five years.
