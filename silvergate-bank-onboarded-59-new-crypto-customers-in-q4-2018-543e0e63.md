Crypto-supportive Silvergate Bank has signed on a slew of new cryptocurrency customers in the fourth quarter on 2018, according to a recent filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The filing reveals that as of Dec. 31, 2018, Silvergate had 542 digital currency-related clients including cryptocurrency exchanges and miners, custodians and global investors, among others.

By Dec. 31, 232 cryptocurrency customers were purportedly in various stages of the bank’s customer onboarding process, including regulatory compliance.

The bank further says that it believes that acceptance of digital currency by traditional financial institutions will continue to grow, highlighting the following data:

“Currently, there are over 300 institutional investment funds with aggregate estimated assets under management of between approximately $7.5 billion to $10 billion.

Per the document, in the fourth quarter of 2018 the bank saw two exchanges, 33 companies, and 24 investors among its new clients, including software developers, cryptocurrency miners, and service providers.

Digital currency investors’ deposits saw a growth by $4.8 million to $577.5 million, while other startups’ balances increased by $46.4 million, reaching $273.9 million.

Last February, the Digital Currency Group (DCG), a cryptocurrency venture capital firm, announced that they had invested in the Silvergate Capital Corporation, which contains the Silvergate Bank.
