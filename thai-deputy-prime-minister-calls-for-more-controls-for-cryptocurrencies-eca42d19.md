The Deputy Prime Minister of Thailand Wissanu Krea-ngam has called for more regulations on cryptocurrencies, local news daily the Bangkok Post reports Nov. 8.

While Thailand introduced a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies earlier this year, Krea-ngam urged that new measures must be introduced both domestically and internationally in order to keep up with new tactics and threats to consumer security.

In addition to forming a clear legal framework for crypto business, Thailand has also allowed its financial institutions enter the industry, albeit with some restrictions.

In August, the Bank of Thailand (BoT) permitted local banks to set up subsidiaries for dealing with crypto business.

While Thai banks can issue digital tokens, provide crypto brokerage services, run crypto-related businesses, and invest in cryptocurrencies through subsidiaries, BoT reaffirmed that all banks and other financial institutions are still banned from direct dealing with cryptocurrencies.

Thailand has also embraced the blockchain technology that underlies cryptocurrencies.

Yesterday, the Thai Revenue Department announced that it plans to track tax payments using blockchain technology and machine learning.
