The Iranian government has taken further steps against Telegram’s cryptocurrency development, the Tehran Times reports Dec. 31.

In December 2017, Iran temporarily blocked Telegram and photo-sharing app Instagram in order to “maintain peace” amid widespread protests.

Prior to the ban, Iranian officials criticized the app, stating that its initial coin offering (ICO) was potentially “undermin\[ing\] the national currency of Iran.”

Hassan Firouzabadi, the secretary of the High Council of Cyberspace approved the suggested ban due to Telegram’s potential for bringing cryptocurrency to all of its Iranian users.

Firouzabadi referred to Telegram as an “enemy of the private sector,” since “Telegram never \[agreed\] to have an office in Iran and refused to work with the private sector.”

The go-to messaging app of the crypto industry was also banned in Russia due to concerns over its ICO, with the possibility of a “completely uncontrolled financial system” reportedly leading to the block.

The ICO sought investment to support the development of the Telegram messenger app and its own blockchain platform Telegraph Open Network.
