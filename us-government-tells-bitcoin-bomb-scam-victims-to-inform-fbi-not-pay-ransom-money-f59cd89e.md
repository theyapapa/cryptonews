A suspected scam which threatens to blow up buildings unless recipients pay a Bitcoin (BTC) ransom caught the attention of the United States’ government Dec. 13.

The scam, which centers on anonymous emails demanding payment of $20,000 in Bitcoin or face a “mercenary” detonating a device in “your building,” has appeared throughout the world.

The NCCIC is “aware of a worldwide email campaign targeting businesses and organizations with bomb threats,” it said.

“The emails claim that a device will detonate unless a ransom in Bitcoin is paid.”

Prior to the government acknowledgment, media sources had reported on the scheme, including cybersecurity publication and research outlet Krebs On Security, which published the full text of the email.

You pay me 20.000 $ in Bitcoin and the bomb will not explode, but don’t try to cheat -I warrant you that I will withdraw my mercenary only after 3 confirmations in blockchain network.”

Phishing scams — hackers masquerading as known entities to trick users into transferring coins to a fake address — have spread from emails to social media platforms such as Twitter en masse this year.
