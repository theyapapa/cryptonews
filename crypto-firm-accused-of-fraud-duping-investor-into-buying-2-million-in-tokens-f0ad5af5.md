A lawsuit recently filed in a United States district court in New York claims that an investor was misled into investing $2 million dollars in the cryptocurrency MCash, a Feb. 1 court filing states.

The filing alleges that the plaintiff Lijun Sun transferred $2 million to New-York based investment group Blue Ocean Capital Group, Inc. to purchase MCash tokens, stating:

“Not only was the MCash Token not properly registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), but more importantly, in connection with selling the MCash Token, Defendants made numerous misrepresentations and omissions that induced Plaintiff to invest $2 million.”

Only after buying the tokens did Sun realize that he would have to enter into a Token Purchase Agreement not with Blue Ocean Capital, but with another company, which defendants purportedly did not disclose.

Sun also alleges that some of the defendants, on behalf of Blue Ocean Capital, committed federal securities fraud and common law fraud.

Sun would not have invested the funds with Blue Ocean Capital, had he known these facts, the filing states.

Blue Ocean Capital’s website is down, but a video celebrating its grand opening in New York is still on YouTube.

The video touts recognitions and awards from Nasdaq senior vice-president Robert McCooney and Felix Ortiz, the Assistant Speaker of the New York State Assembly.
