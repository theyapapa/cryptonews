# Bloomberg: Proof-of-Stake Token Investors Could Use Staking For Gains During Bear Market ...

###### 2019-02-01 06:02

A Bloomberg article published today, Feb. 1, suggests that proof-of-stake (PoS) token investors have a unique option to survive the protracted crypto market slump: staking their holdings.

As Bloomberg reports, staking holdings in a PoS network can yield returns from 5 to as high as 150 percent, depending on the size of the participant’s stake.

Kyle Samani, managing partner at crypto fund Multicoin Capital Management, argued that:

"Regardless of market conditions, staking provides returns denominated in the asset being staked.

Bloomberg reports that firms specializing in staking holdings for clients are proliferating in the context of the crypto market slump.

Paul Veradittakit, partner at major crypto investment firm Pantera Capital, proposed that not only market conditions, but also the increasing popularity of PoS protocols, is driving the trend:

"As we see more \[PoS\] protocols emerge, the ability to stake your tokens and earn interest from staking is a great way to make money, an ability to make strong consistent returns."

Moreover, especially for clients of crypto staking firms, Bloomberg’s Aaron Brown argued that “staking requires a certain amount of trust, unlike proof-of-work.

As reported, crypto staking startup Staked — which targets institutional PoS token investors — has just announced the closure of a $4.5 million seed funding round, led by Pantera Capital.
