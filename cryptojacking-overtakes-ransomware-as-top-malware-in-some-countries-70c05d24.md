Cryptojacking, the unauthorized use of another’s hardware to mine cryptocurrency, has become the biggest cyber threat in many parts of the world, Bloomberg reported Dec. 14.

According to research from cyber security research firm Kaspersky Lab, cryptojacking overtook ransomware as the biggest cybersecurity threat particularly in the Middle East, Turkey, and Africa.

In Afghanistan and Ethiopia over one out of four detected malware are cryptocurrency miners, according to Kaspersky’s data.

As cited by the Bloomberg, Kaspersky’s research “shows crypto mining attacks have risen almost fourfold in the region, from 3.5 million in 2017 to 13 million this year.”

A report released by Kaspersky in November declares that the reason for the rise of cryptojacking malware compared to ransomware may “be due to the fact that people from developing markets are not so eager to pay a ransom.”

Fabio Assolini, Kaspersky’s Senior Security Researcher, told Bloomberg that “the \[Middle East, Turkey, Africa\] region is becoming more appealing to cyber-criminals, with financial and malicious cryptomining attacks taking center stage.”

Assolini also claimed that such attacks are becoming increasingly popular because they are “less noticeable” than ransomware.
