Major fiat-crypto trading platform OKCoin has partnered with fintech firm Simplex to enable global users to make USD deposits via debit or credit card.

As an European Union-licensed financial institution and payments processing provider, Simplex — which has offices in Israel, the United Kingdom, United States and Lithuania — will offer card-enabled USD deposits for OKCoin users outside of Europe, China and the U.S., according to the press release.

According to the press release, Simplex leverages AI and proprietary detection algorithms to analyze transactions and mitigate the risks of fraudulent card payments.

The newly-supported card services for USD deposits on OKCoin notably stipulate a minimum deposit of $50, with Simplex charging a 5% processing fee for each transaction.

In a statement, Simplex CEO Nimrod Lehavi expressed his belief that credit card functionality is crucial to expedite mainstream cryptocurrency adoption.

Earlier this year, top crypto exchange Binance added support for credit card crypto purchases through a similar partnership with Simplex.

In March, Singapore-based exchange KuCoin followed suit, revealing its Simplex partnership for users across over 100 countries.
