Multisectoral blockchain company Bitfury has partnered with the Plekhanov Russian University of Economics to create an accelerator for blockchain projects, Russian crypto news outlet Forklog reports Nov. 21.

In addition to supporting the development of blockchain projects, the university will provide courses and additional education dedicated to “training specialists who are able to create innovative projects using digital technologies in a short time.”

This will enable specialists to “bring \[the projects\] to market amid the new industrial revolution,” Dmitry Ufaev, the head of Bitfury Russia, told Forklog.

According to Forklog, the project will be backed by Russia’s Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media.

Earlier this week, Tokyo University announced a course in blockchain technology after various companies — including Japanese banking giant Sumitomo Mitsui — donated $800,000 to support the program.

In October, the University of Gibraltar established an advisory group that will focus on the development of blockchain-related educational courses.

The New Technologies in Education group is reportedly a joint initiative between the government, the university, and a number of the leading technology firms based in the country.
