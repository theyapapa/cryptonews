United States cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has announced that it is giving away 1 billion Stellar Lumens (XLM) (about $106 million) to users that are willing to study the Stellar protocol.

Each eligible U.S. user can gain up to $50 for using the program to study the Stellar protocol.

According to the Coinbase Earn website, the program developed in partnership with Stellar consists of five educational videos of up to three minutes each.

Earlier this month, Coinbase added support for XLM on its main retail investor platform.

The cryptocurrency was available to the majority of customers, with the exception of Coinbase users in the United Kingdom or in the U.S. state of New York, at the time of writing.

Prior to that, the companyâ€™s professional trading platform, Coinbase Pro, announced it was accepting XLM deposits.

Back then, cryptocurrency wallet provider Blockchain.com launched full support for the token, alongside giving away $125 million worth of XLM to its user base.
