The Croatian Post has partnered with Electrocoin to run a pilot program for a crypto-to-fiat exchange in the city of Zadar.

The pilot service will reportedly enable crypto holders to convert Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Stellar (XLM), XRP and EOS to cash in one of the Croatian Post’s local offices, according to an announcement by the postal service on July 24.

The exchange pilot is currently available at three post offices in Zadar in order to gauge market interest in the service.

The Croatian Post ultimately aims to spread the service to major cities and tourist centers throughout Croatia.

According to the announcement, the Croatian Post’s partner Electrocoin has been running it’s Bitcoin brokerage for five years.

In February, Lichtenstein’s official postal service, Liechtensteinische Post AG, announced plans to offer cryptocurrency exchange services at their physical locations.

Liechtensteinische Post will reportedly further develop the service by increasing the daily exchange limit from 1,000 Swiss francs ($1,009) to 20,000 francs ($20,189), and expanding to more locations.
