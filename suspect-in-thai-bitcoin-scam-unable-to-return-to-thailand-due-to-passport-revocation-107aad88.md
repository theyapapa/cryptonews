According to the report, Prinya Jaravijit was in the U.S. after a cryptocurrency investment scheme surfaced in which he and several accomplices allegedly defrauded a Finnish investor of $24 million.

The Crime Suppression Divisionâ€™s (CSD) deputy commander Pol Col Chakrit Sawasdee claimed on Wednesday that the Foreign Ministry invalidated the passport of the prime suspect Jaravijit.

Sawasdee reportedly ordered the suspect to turn himself in by Monday, but Jaravijit stated that he was not able return to Thailand since his passport was revoked, making his stay in the U.S. illegal.

Jaravijit was reportedly in the process of handling his return with the Thai embassy in the U.S.

On Tuesday, the Thai Anti-Money Laundering Office (AMLO) confiscated funds worth $6.4 million from Jaravijit's family and other people connected to the case.

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Jaravijit and his accomplices are accused of defrauding Finnish millionaire Aarni Otava Saarima and his business partner, who were lured into investing their Bitcoin (BTC) in a fake investment scheme involving three companies and gambling-focused crypto token Dragon Coin.

The deputy commander reported that the other suspects have all been members of the Jaravijit family, including investor Prasit Srisuwan and businessman Chakrit Ahmad, who reportedly have reached a compensation settlement with the Finnish investor.

The case first came to light in August, when Thai police arrested 27-year old soap-opera star Jiratpisit "Boom" Jaravijit, who is reportedly one of the seven suspects involved in the $24 million crypto scam.
