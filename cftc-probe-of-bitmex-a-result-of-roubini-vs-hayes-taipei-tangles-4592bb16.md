# CFTC Probe of BitMEX a Result of Roubini Vs. Hayes Taipei Tangle? ...

Soon after Nouriel Roubini, a New York University professor of economics and anti-cryptocurrency pundit, criticized BitMEX of violating regulations, it was reported on July 19 that United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is opening an investigation into BitMEX on whether it broke the law by allowing U.S. residents to trade on its platform.

## The Tangle in Taipei and regulations 

It may be possible to take a look at BitMEX’s stance on regulations from The Tangle in Taipei, the debate between an American economist Nouriel Roubini and BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes on July 3.

Roubini also suggested that U.S. investors are not allowed to conduct such kind of leveraged trading because of U.S. regulation, but “anyone with VPN can avoid the IP and go and do investments with you guys \[BitMEX\].”

Although the probe would reportedly take a number of months, Mati Greenspan, a senior market analyst at eToro, suspected that the Tangel in Taipei might have motivated the U.S. to probe BitMEX.

A spokesperson for BitMEX replied to a request from Cointelegraph for comment regarding the reports of a new investigation as follows:

“HDR Global Trading Limited, owner of BitMEX, as a matter of company policy, does not comment on any media reports about inquiries or investigations by government agencies or regulators and we have no comment on this report."

## The U.S. and unregulated crypto exchanges

It may be worth noting that BitMEX is not the only major crypto exchange that is being pressured by U.S. regulatory authorities.

If the CFTC concludes that BitMEX has been violating the law by allowing American traders to use its platform, it could provide a significant shock to the industry.
