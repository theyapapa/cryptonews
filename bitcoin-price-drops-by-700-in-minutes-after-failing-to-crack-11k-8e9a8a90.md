The move counters previous theories that Bitcoin price could grow to reclaim $11,000 support, something reported by Cointelegraph on Tuesday.

Fresh figures from crypto research firm Digital Asset Research this week suggested that come May 2020, the date of the Bitcoin block reward halving, BTC/USD will have mushroomed to over $60,000.

All but one of the top twenty cryptocurrencies by market cap posted similar losses to Bitcoin over the past 24 hours.

The overall cryptocurrency market cap was $266 billion at press time, with Bitcoinâ€™s share at just under 69%.
