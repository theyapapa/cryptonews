Bitcoin Core developer Peter Wuille has introduced new Bitcoin (BTC) smart contract programming language dubbed Miniscript.

Wuille, a creator of major Bitcoin network upgrade SegWit, announced the Miniscript project website on the mailing list message for Bitcoin developers on Aug. 19.

## Mini-Bitcoin script

Miniscript is a language for writing a subset of Bitcoin scripts in a structured way, which enables analysis, composition, generic signing and others, as Wuille describes it in short.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin script is a basic programming language that makes smart contracts on Bitcoin network possible by enabling users to set specific conditions for a certain transaction to be completed.

According to Wuille, the adoption of Miniscript language could reduce some barriers between pieces of software used in smart contracts, also providing a multisig ecosystem that functions in a more effective way that simple script language.

## Script analysis made easier

While Miniscript is basically a reformulation of Bitcoin script, it remains the same script language, but instead allows wallets and other software to construct and analyze scripts more effectively, Wuille explained on Reddit.

In the post, Wuille provided an example of how the same notation would look in basic Bitcoin script in comparison with one in Miniscript language.
