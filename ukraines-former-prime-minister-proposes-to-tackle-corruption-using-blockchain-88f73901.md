Ukraine’s former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko, who is currently running a presidential campaign for the March 2019 elections, wants to tackle corruption using blockchain, according to a recent Facebook post from Sunday, Dec. 9.

The former prime minister mentioned blockchain technology as an effective tool for public administration.

According to Tymoshenko, in order to prevent corruption, state registries should be stored on a blockchain.

Tymoshenko has previously called blockchain the ideal technology for combating corruption when she presented at a forum in Kiev last June.

In order to completely eliminate corruption in public registries and to protect each citizen's personal data, we have to transfer all administration systems to blockchain.”

Oleksandr Stelmakh, the head of the State Register at the Central Electoral Commission of Ukraine, said that they are “continu\[ing\] a series of experiments applying blockchain technology within electoral voting.”

The country is also considering the issuance of a state-owned digital currency, the e-hryvnia, which would be based on a blockchain and tied to the national fiat currency, the hryvnia.
