Bob Summerwill, a developer at blockchain tech company ConsenSys, has joined the Ethereum Classic Cooperative as its executive director, according to an official announcement on Jan. 29.

The Ethereum Classic Cooperative manages the development and growth of the Ethereum Classic (ETC) cryptocurrency’s protocol.

Ethereum Classic is the result of a hard fork in 2016, arising out of differences into how to respond to the high-profile DAO hack of the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain.

Per the announcement, Summerwill will develop relationships that help the mission of the organization and grow ETC’s development and community.

Earlier this month, Ethereum Classic developers said that a mining pool claiming over 50 percent of the network’s hashrate was “most likely selfish mining.”

American cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase had published a blog post stating that it “detected a deep chain reorganization of the Ethereum Classic blockchain that included a double spend” on Jan. 5.

Ethereum Classic is currently the 17th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, according to data from CoinMarketCap.
