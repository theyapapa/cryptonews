# China: Crypto Miners Sell off Mining Devices ‘by Kilo’ Amidst Market Decline ...

###### 2018-11-22 16:11

Cryptocurrency mining operations in China are reportedly selling mining machines by weight, as opposed to price per unit.

This selloff was reported by local Chinese crypto outlet 8BTC Wednesday, Nov. 21, with reference to the cryptocurrency mining pool F2Pool.

According to local Chinese outlet Tencent News, the earnings from mining are no longer enough to cover electric power and other associated costs.

The market slump has reportedly affected mostly small and medium-sized mining operations in the Chinese regions of Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia.

Bitcoin’s price has kept falling, along with the rest of the crypto market, since the hard fork network upgrade of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) that took place Nov. 15.

Earlier this month, Bitcoin mining giant Bitmain announced plans to reach out to local mining farms in the coal-rich province of Xinjiang, and deploy around 90,000 Antminer S9 devices in the region.

In September, the CEO of F2Pool published an infographic that indicated that if Bitcoin price would reach lower than 36,792 Chinese yuan (about $5,376), mining the cryptocurrency with an Antminer T9 would become unprofitable.
