A blockchain platform is enabling creators to share their music, videos and webtoons with the masses, all while ensuring that their copyright is protected.

The company claims that an extensive range of Korean and global artists have gotten involved with its platform so far, delivering exclusive, limited-edition content to fans.

## Changing tune

According to ContentsDeal, the evolution of platforms such as YouTube and Spotify — which enable consumers to listen to music on demand — have been great news for the public but frustrating for content creators.

However, ContentsDeal alleges that very little of this revenue ends up making its way back to the content creator.

“People who participate in the ContentsDeal ecosystem will experience safer and enhanced transparency in their content trade… and get more top-tier music,” a Medium blog post added.

The startup also plans to help the webtoons industry, and claims that platforms have been failing to develop at the same pace as content creators.

Looking ahead, ContentsDeal is hoping to forge new partnerships to enhance the breadth of music, webtoons and videos on its platform.
