Singapore-based blockchain platform VeChain Foundation, U.S. blockchain startup CREAM, and the national investment partner of the Republic of Cyprus, Invest Cyprus, have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), per a press release published Oct. 26.

Per the MoU, the parties will work on a number of national level investment strategies, which involve blockchain-powered economies and promote blockchain technology, particularly in financial services.

The agreement also aims to inform government policy making in the blockchain industry, in addition to facilitating economic development in Cyprus.

In order to complete the designated objectives, VeChain and CREAM will reportedly found a joint venture in Cyprus, that will assist in the development and implementation of blockchain solutions.

Michalis P. Michael, Chairman of Invest Cyprus, said that Invest Cyprus sees blockchain “as both transformational and fiscally restorative at the infrastructure level.”

Michel added:

“We are investing in the development of the fintech, blockchain sector and we plan to be at the forefront so that we can facilitate investments and economic development in Cyprus and the region."

In November last year, the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC) announced its intention to integrate blockchain in its electronic payment system through a partnership with the Blockchain Technology for Algorithmic Regulation and Compliance Association (BARAC).
