# Iran Developing National Blockchain Platform on IBM Hyperledger Fabric ...

The Central Bank of Iran (CBI), via its Informatics and Services Corporation (ISC) and in conjunction with Areatak — a Tehran-based blockchain solutions provider — is developing a national blockchain project for its banking and financial sector.

Called the Borna platform, Iran hopes to use the project to revamp its banking ecosystem, creating a digital financial economy that will replace the current legacy system.

The developers expect Borna to function as a central digital platform for the country’s banking and financial sectors.

## Upgrading Iran’s outdated banking system using blockchain

At the heart of the Borna project is the upscaling and complete revamping of Iran’s financial industry.

With the Iranian parliament currently examining likely changes to the country’s banking laws, Borna may yet play a pivotal role in the future destiny of Iran’s financial market.

According to Khoshbakht:

“There are people in Iran who might have the mindset that they would be able to bypass the sanctions using blockchain technology and that could be the reason why a lot of people would think that we'd be trying to do the same, but in the case of Borna the reality is that the project is just meant to utilize blockchain's capabilities in the enterprise level and especially in the financial and banking industry.

Such a platform will be executed on top of the current monetary and banking systems of Iran as a domestic solution designed to be used only and only inside the borders of Iran with respect to the required financial transparency for the people, the government of Iran, and international standards such as combating of money laundering and the financing of terrorism.”
