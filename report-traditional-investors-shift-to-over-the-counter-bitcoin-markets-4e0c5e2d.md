# Report: Traditional Investors Shift to Over-The-Counter Bitcoin Markets ...

In its recent analysis published Dec. 17, research firm Diar has found that institutional investors have shifted towards higher liquidity over-the-counter (OTC) physical Bitcoin (BTC) markets.

Diar noted growing investment in OTC funds like that offered by major American cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase.

According to the report, Coinbase outperformed Grayscaleâ€™s Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) on OTC markets in terms of BTC trade volume.

While OTC trade volumes are dwarfed by non-OTC investment, it is still significant as OTC markets are only open for 31 percent of annual tradable hours.

In 2018, Coinbase reportedly saw a 20 percent increase in BTC trading volume during OTC markets hours, while GBTC saw a 35 percent drop in volumes comparing with the same period in 2017.

As Cointelegraph previously reported, Coinbase launched OTC trading for institutional customers in late November.

The move reportedly took place in conjunction with an increased demand for OTC crypto trading from institutional players.
