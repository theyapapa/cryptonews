# Everything But Crypto, Or How the ‘Crypto’ Movie Does Not Live Up to Its Name ...

It is revealed that a major bank, because (one character explains) such banks are terrified of being made irrelevant by cryptocurrencies, is secretly buying crypto in order to drive the price up, on the theory that high prices will make cryptocurrencies unaffordable and dissuade people from buying them.

The Russian mob, which is laundering money through that same bank, is doing some of its laundering by the use of crypto.

All of this is explored, or stumbled upon, by the film’s main character, Martin Duran, played by Beau Knapp.

Martin is allegedly a top-ranked business school graduate who has a fairly mundane job as a compliance officer for the major bank.

Regardless, Martin’s new job as the branch’s compliance officer involves a specific brief to keep an eye out for money laundering.

The women working at the gallery find Martin attractive, which is among the film’s least likely plot turns.

The mob gets wind that Martin, with the help of his friend — the failing liquor store owner, who also happens to be a genius hacker — is looking into its affairs.
