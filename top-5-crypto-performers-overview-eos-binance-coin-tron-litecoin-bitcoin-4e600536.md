The exchange has added six new pairs, with Circle’s USD-pegged stablecoin USD Coin recently being included in its Combined Stablecoin Market.

The LTC/USD pair has been in a strong downtrend since peaking out at $370 in December of last year.

During bear markets, prices can drop to crazy levels, which turns out to be a good buying opportunity for the brave hearted who can go against the trend.
