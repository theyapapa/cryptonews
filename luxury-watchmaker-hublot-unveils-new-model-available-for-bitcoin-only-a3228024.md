###### 2018-09-28 15:09

Swiss luxury watch brand Hublot has unveiled its new watch Big Bang Blockchain in an official announcement September 19.

The new model has been released to commemorate the upcoming 10th anniversary of Bitcoin (BTC).

The elite Swiss brand has also paid a tribute to blockchain technology, calling it "a revolution in the financial system".

Hublot further explained the importance of decentralization:

"By allowing digital information to be distributed, Blockchain technology creates the backbone of a new type of Internet.

The Swiss brand is not the only one to commemorate Bitcoin's upcoming anniversary.

The white paper, titled "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System," was released on bitcoin.org on October 31 – a date that is widely considered as ground zero for BTC, although the first actual bitcoin was mined on January 3, 2009.

Over the almost ten years since the mining of the first Bitcoin block, many have proclaimed the cryptocurrency dead – more than 300 times overall, as Cointelegraph reported earlier.Array
