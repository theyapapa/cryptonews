India’s supreme court has slammed the country’s central bank over its handling of a cryptocurrency business ban and ordered it to address complaints.

## Judge: RBI has not properly responded to representation

In the latest session of an ongoing hearing into the actions of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Aug. 21, the Court ruled officials had not appropriately responded to concerns from the cryptocurrency industry over its actions.

The RBI forbade banks servicing crypto operators such as exchanges in July 2018, effectively ending the ability for such platforms to continue operating in India.

As summarized by advisory resource Crypto Kanoon, present at the hearing, Nariman gave the RBI just two weeks to justify its actions.

“Now justice Nariman questions RBI why you have not properly responded to the representation.

## RBI agrees to 2-Week deadline

Discussing the final outcome of the hearing, which is now over, Crypto Kanoon summarized:

“Case takes the most unlredictable turn.

Justice Nariman directs that RBI must respond to the representation in the manner appropriate.
