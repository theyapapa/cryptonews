# Huobi Global Absorbs Australian Unit Amid Bear Market, Reveals Recent Layoffs ...

Eight months after its launch, Huobi’s Australian subsidiary is to be subsumed under the Huobi Global canopy, according to an official tweet published on Feb. 24.

In a Facebook post published today, Feb. 25, Huobi Australia cited the crypto market slump and fresh redundancies as the reason for the development.

As previously reported, Singapore-headquartered Huobi Global launched its Australian platform in July 2018, saying at the time that “the move to Australia is a natural fit.”

According to Huobi Australia’s announcements, the subsumption under Huobi Global will take effect as of tomorrow, Feb. 26:

“Please be informed that due to poor market conditions and associated recent staff redundancies here at Huobi Australia, all operations, including the management of our platform, social media channels and customer support will be managed by our team at Huobi Global headquarters starting 26th February 2019.”

Huobi Global is not alone in opting to reduce its head count and close regional operations to survive the crypto market slump.

Despite these reported redundancies and cessation of its Australia-specific operations, Huobi Global nonetheless recently claimed it had seen 100 percent growth in worldwide trading volumes in 2018 over 2017.

At press time, Huobi Global is ranked fifth largest crypto exchange globally by daily adjusted volumes, seeing around $957 million in trades over the past 24 hours.
