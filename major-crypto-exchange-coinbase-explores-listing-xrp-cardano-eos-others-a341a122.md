Major United States-based crypto exchange Coinbase is “exploring” the possibility of providing trading support for over 30 cryptocurrencies.

List of cryptocurrencies Coinbase is considering to add.

Coinbase added that a cryptocurrency being present in the list is not a guarantee that it will ultimately be added, as any coins could face some restrictions or might not be listed at all, after their evaluation is finished:

“Adding new assets requires significant exploratory work from both a technical and compliance standpoint, and we cannot guarantee that all the assets we are evaluating will ultimately be listed for trading.

Furthermore, our listing process may result in some of these assets being listed solely for customers to buy and sell, without the ability to send or receive using a local wallet.”

Back in September, Coinbase announced a new listing process that would allow it to add digital assets faster than before.

However, the crypto exchange has pointed out that the new procedure only applied to digital assets that were compliant with their local regulations.

Thus, certain assets listed by Coinbase might only be available to customers in particular jurisdictions.
