The charity arm of the world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance, has launched its pilot blockchain-based lunch program in African schools, according to a blog post on Feb. 21.

Binance Charity Foundation (BCF) has rolled out its charity campaign “Lunch for Children” in the capital of Uganda, Kampala.

According to the program, the organization is set to provide two meals a day during the full year of 2019 to more than 200 students and school staff.

The recently launched pilot in Uganda is a part of a larger campaign by Binance that intends to benefit one million students in schools across other countries such as Rwanda, Kenya and Ethiopia.

Based on BCF’s blockchain-based donation system, the campaign was first announced during Binance Blockchain week in Singapore last January, the blog post notes.

Binance first launched its charity arm in October 2018, revealing that the initiative was supported at the time by a donation of $3 million from the Tron Foundation.

Recently, the ALS Association partnered with the Tron Foundation to launch a blockchain-enabled campaign to raise donations for research into treatments for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease.
