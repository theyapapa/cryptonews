In what remains common practice, most altcoins that make up the top twenty cryptocurrencies by market cap repeated Bitcoin’s stability.

Ethereum (ETH), the largest altcoin, lost around 1 percent in the 24 hours to press time, still trading around $135, which it has done since March 5.

The top twenty exhibited only one exception to the trend in the form of Stellar’s Lumens token (XLM), which made daily gains in excess of 12 percent on the back of a partnership with solarisBank.

Further down CoinMarketCap’s table, Tezos (XTZ) also put in a strong performance, rising around 11 percent.
