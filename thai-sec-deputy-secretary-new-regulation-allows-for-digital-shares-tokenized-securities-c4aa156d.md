The Thai Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) deputy secretary-general Tipsuda Thavaramara has said that the recently introduced regulation allows for the issuance of digital shares and a tokenized securities depository platform.

Per the report, the SEC urges all stakeholders to prepare for the amended act, which aims to help Thailand introduce blockchain use in trade and security tokenization.

A major change made to the regulation reportedly allows scripless transactions to cover the primary market for all types of securities, while they were previously only allowed on the secondary market.

This change would open the system to tokenized securities, the Bangkok Post reports.

The outlet cites Thavaramara as commenting:

“This change will have a major impact as the amended Act provides a legal basis to support \[the country's capital market\] the tokenisation platform.”

The report states that the amended act allows for a tokenized securities depository platform and the issuance of digital shares in the primary market.

As Cointelegraph reported in February, Thailand’s National Legislative Assembly has officially allowed the issuance of tokenized securities on blockchain.
