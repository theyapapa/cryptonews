Decentralized social media platform Mithril (MITH) has adopted the Binance Chain, the mainnet of the leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance.

With the step, Mithril — a social media platform that rewards content creators with its native token MITH — becomes the purported first to shift to the Binanche Chain, with MITH token migrating from ERC-20 to BEP2.

At Mithril, users gain MITH through Mithril mining, while managing their assets on the company’s platform VAULT.

Binance users will be able to withdraw MITH to BEP2 wallets following the completion of the initial migration of ERC-20-based MITH to BEP2.

Binance launched Binance Chain yesterday, April 18, and expects to execute the swap of its native token Binance Coin (BNB) on April 23.

Along with the launch of Binance Chain, the exchange provided details for the conversion of ERC-20 BNB tokens into native Binance Chain-based BNB (BEP2) coins.

As such, Binance emphasized it will not support the withdrawal of ERC-20 BNB tokens after April 23.
