Demand for legal experts with blockchain technology knowledge is high, according to Major, Lindsey & Africa managing director Brian Burlant, who recruits for law firms and in-house legal departments.

According to Burlant, law firms are having difficulty keeping up with cryptocurrency and blockchain industry demands for lawyers because of a lack of candidates who really understand the technology.

Burlant stated that “for law students and those early in their legal careers, coupling a practical business approach with a working understanding of the technology is a good way to go.”

He further advised that law students focus on blockchain, and not on cryptocurrencies, as blockchain “will be a game changer.”

Mary K. Young, a partner at Zeughauser Group,said:

“I think that the blockchain space was extremely popular for lawyers toward the end of 2017, and then the cryptocurrency crash happened, and a lot of lawyers who were working in crypto or blockchain went back quietly to whatever they were doing before, like Silicon Valley in the ’90s.”

As recently published forecasts predict, global blockchain spending could account for almost $2.9 billion in 2019, which is an 88.7% increase from 2018.

Additionally, a recent survey conducted by Big Four auditing firm KPMG revealed that most tax and finance executives do not consider adopting blockchain technology.
