A crypto exchange has announced that it has renewed its sponsorship of an English Premier League football team for the second season running.

CoinDeal says the extension of its deal with Wolverhampton Wanderers gives the company the chance to get its brand in front of football fans around the world.

According to the company, the sponsorship opportunity has forged new friendships and given its staff a newfound passion for football — so much so that the team regularly cheered on the Wolves throughout their Premier League campaign as they rubbed shoulders with the likes of Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester United and Liverpool.

## Heading stateside

CoinDeal says it has become the largest crypto-fiat exchange in Europe since launching back in March 2018, but isn’t content sitting still.

Right now, CoinDeal claims that many existing exchanges are failing to meet the expectations of consumers — and the team believes there is an unparalleled, untapped potential of liquidity and potential traders who can benefit from their cutting-edge infrastructure.

Alex Strześniewski, the exchange’s business development director, said, “The US is the land of opportunity, and this may very well be the defining moment in our company's history.”

## A powerful exchange

CoinDeal says that it offers its user base more than 40 cryptocurrency pairs — bringing together Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin with major fiat currencies including the euro, dollar, British pound, Polish zloty and Russian ruble.
