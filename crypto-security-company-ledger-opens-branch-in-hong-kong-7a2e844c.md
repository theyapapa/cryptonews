Crypto hardware wallet firm Ledger has announced it is opening a new branch in Hong Kong, according to a press release shared with Cointelegraph Wednesday, Oct. 31.

One of the leading hardware wallet manufacturers with headquarters in Paris and San Francisco, Ledger also reveals that it has assigned Benjamin Soong as head of the Asia Pacific (APAC), responsible for all Ledger operations held in the region.

Ledger’s president Pascal Gauthier further explained that Soong will help the company monetize its opportunities in APAC:

“He brings a tremendous amount of experience and expertise in the region, which will help Ledger capitalize on future opportunities.

Prior to the recent announcement, Ledger, together with software provider for cryptocurrency Blockchain.com, had revealed it is launching a hardware wallet that is fully compatible with the Blockchain Wallet.

As Cointelegraph wrote in July, Ledger reportedly attracted the interest of tech giants like Samsung, Google's venture arm GV, and Siemens after the company managed to sell more than one million hardware crypto wallets throughout 2017, earning a profit of $29 million.

Recently Hong Kong officials have revealed plans to introduce crypto regulations.

In June, Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) said that the regulator was keeping “a close watch” on crypto and ICOs, “intervening when appropriate.”
