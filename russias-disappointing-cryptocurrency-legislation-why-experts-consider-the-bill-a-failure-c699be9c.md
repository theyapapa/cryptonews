# Russia’s ‘Disappointing’ Cryptocurrency Legislation: Why Experts Consider the Bill a Failure ...

###### 2018-09-29 07:09

The problems arising within Russia over how to regulate cryptocurrencies have taken the form of conflicts between the Russian Central Bank’s more conservative stance and the Ministry of Economic Development’s willingness to embrace a new technology with the hope of attracting more business to the country.

Tolkachev, who has been chairman of the Russian Blockchain.community since 2016 and founded the Blockchain Lab at Deloitte CIS, said that the current version of the crypto and blockchain legislation — which takes its form in three draft bills — has not lived up to his expectations.

Speaking to Cointelegraph, Tolkachev said that “of course” he is “disappointed by the current version of the regulation,” noting that the three bills — “On Digital Technologies,” regulation of the central bank on crowdfunding (including Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) and amendments to the Russian Civil Code — were prepared independently, which makes their legislation “rather ineffective.”

This first variation of the bill was originally opposed by the Bank of Russia, according to local news outlet TASS, which reported at the time that the central bank disagreed with the way transactions between crypto, rubles and foreign currencies were laid out.

In March of this year, a group of Russian deputies headed by the Chairman Aksakov submitted the first draft of legislation on cryptocurrencies and ICOs to the State Duma, as well as a draft of the bill “On Alternative Methods of Fundraising (Crowdfunding).”

January’s disagreement between the central bank and MinFin had been solved in March, according to local news outlet Ria Novosti, with the Bank of Russia noting that it will be considered permissible to exchange rubles, foreign currencies or property for tokens issued by Russian ICOs, while it will not be allowed to use cryptocurrencies due to the possibility of “questionable transactions.”

Also in March, Igor Sudets, a member of the Duma’s expert panel on the digital economy and blockchain, said that due to the proposed bill’s limit on domestic investment in Russia ICOs, investors may not want to conduct Russian ICOs, according to Forklog:

“I very much hope that \[ICO investment specifications\] will be substantially finalized for the second reading.
