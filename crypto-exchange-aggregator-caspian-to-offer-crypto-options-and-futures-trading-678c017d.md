Institutional crypto trading, portfolio and risk management platform Caspian announced that it has integrated its platform with cryptocurrency futures and options trading exchange Deribit.

Per the announcement, Deribit has been added to Caspian’s ecosystem of over 30 cryptocurrency exchanges and liquidity providers.

The company also claims that the move renders it the first institutional platform to offer both options and futures trading in the crypto asset class.

The post also notes that Caspian’s platform includes an order and execution management system, portfolio management system and risk management system and connects into major crypto exchanges and over-the-counter brokers.

As Cointelegraph reported in December last year, Malta-based major cryptocurrency exchange OKEx also launched a crypto derivative product with support for up to 100x leverage.

In February, digital asset management fund Grayscale Investments claimed in a report that institutional investors provide 66 percent of capital inflow into crypto.

The same month, Liechtenstein-based Bank Frick announced that it is launching a competing institutional cryptocurrency trading platform subsidiary, DLT Markets.
