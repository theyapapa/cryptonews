A report released on April 9 by DApp (Decentralized Application) analytics website DApp.com reveals that Tron (TRX) has the fastest growing DApp user base while Ethereum’s (ETH) DApp user base is shrinking.

On the Ethereum chain, there was a 4 percent decrease in the number of DApp users compared to last year.

The number of active DApp users on the Tron blockchain reportedly amounted to over 300,000, while on EOS around 260,000.

Also, by the end of Q1 2019, the number of Tron wallets reportedly exceeded $2.3 million and about 15.46 percent of them interacted with DApps.

The main driver of growth in the number of Tron DApp users were purportedly gambling apps.

About 85 percent of Tron’s DApp users interacted with the apps in Q1 2019, which means that this is the most active chain among the four blockchains.

The report also points out that 95 percent of EOS DApps reported a transaction in the first quarter of the current year, as did over 80 percent of Tron and Steem (STEEM) based decentralized applications.
