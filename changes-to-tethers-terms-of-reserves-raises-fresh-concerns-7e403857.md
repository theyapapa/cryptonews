# Changes to Tether’s Terms of Reserves Raises Fresh Concerns ...

###### 2019-03-24 14:03

While the exact date of the change is not known, Tether’s website has seemingly adjusted the details of how it ensures a reserve for circulating tokens, with the “100% Backed” statement no longer claiming that every USDT is backed by fiat currency:

“Every tether is always 100% backed by our reserves, which include traditional currency and cash equivalents and, from time to time, may include other assets and receivables from loans made by Tether to third parties, which may include affiliated entities.”

Replying to questions from Cointelegraph, Demeester said in an email the main concern was how Tether would be investing some its reserves and the liquidity of those assets in order to satisfy the potential redemption of a large amount of tokens at any given time:

“I can only speculate, but based on USDT currently trading almost at par with USD, I would venture a guess that at this moment Tether does have adequate cash reserves to survive a “run on the bank.”

Writing directly to Cointelegraph, Ulrich’s focus was not on whether Tether has the necessary reserves for circulating USDT, but the quality and nature of these reserves:

“I do believe Tether has 100% of reserves for issued tokens.

First, Hoegner stated that Tether’s reserve includes cash, cash equivalents, and other assets - while maintaining that these reserves are equal to or greater than the amount of USDT in circulation.

Hoegner declined to elaborate on the type of assets that the company would be using as reserves, but said the decision to change its reserve policy was a result of the changing stablecoin landscape:

“We generally do not comment on the specific composition of our reserves, but this change in optionality reflects the growth of Tether and the growth of the stablecoin industry -- and attendant, non-demand account options -- more generally.”

When asked to comment on claims that Tether does not have reserves equal to the amount of USDT in circulation, Hoegner asserted that the company did have necessary reserves and was openly transparent about its holding on its website:

“Tethers remain completely stable and 100% backed, so Tether’s reserves always equal or exceed the number of issued Tethers.

Ulrich also brings up an interesting point regarding the major holders of USDT and what situations could test the liquidity of Tether and its reserves.
