Cryptocurrency enthusiast and antivirus software namesake John McAfee appears to have been released by authorities in the Dominican Republic today.

On July 23, a post was made on McAfee’s twitter account, allegedly by McAfee’s campaign manager Rob Benedicto Pacifico Juan Maria Loggia-Ramirez, saying that McAfee and his boat crew had likely been detained.

McAfee announced that Loggia-Ramirez would be his presidential campaign manager in October 2018.

According to the report, McAfee was arrested on the north coast of the Dominican Republic, while docking his yacht in Puerto Plata, after which authorities seized high-calibre weapons and other military props from his vessel.

## McAfee’s presidential campaign in exile

McAfee has been running a campaign for President of the United States from self-imposed exile.

McAfee said:

“The IRS has convened a grand jury in the state of Tennessee to charge myself, my wife \[...\] and four of my campaign workers with unspecified IRS crimes of a felonious nature.”

McAfee has also said that his campaign is not a serious bid for office, but rather a means to promote cryptocurrency.
