French retail giant Carrefour has continued blockchain development by applying the technology for tracking milk, according to a press release published on March 1.

Starting from March, the retail giant is gradually rolling out its new blockchain-powered product, Carrefour Quality Line (CQL) micro-filtered full-fat milk.

With CQL, consumers will be able to see the GPS coordinates of farmers whose animals’ milk was collected, get information about when the milk was collected and packaged, as well as find out about various stakeholders involved in the product line.

Carrefour’s new product has followed a number of previous blockchain implementations by the major global food retailer.

Previously, the retail giant had joined IBM’s blockchain-enabled food tracking network called Foot Trust, following major food producers such as Nestle, Dole Food, Golden State Foods and others.

In late 2018, another French retail group, Auchan, expanded TE-FOOD’s FoodChain solution to five more countries after a 18-month test of TE-FOOD’s blockchain tool in Vietnam.

The blockchain product, which enables retail monitoring system for tracking for selected product categories, became available in France, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Senegal.
