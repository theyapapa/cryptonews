68% of global high-net-worth individuals have already invested or are planning to invest in crypto by the end of 2022, according to a survey by Dubai-based financial consultancy firm deVere Group released on May 3.

More than two-thirds of global individuals whose assets’ value is equivalent or greater than 1 million British pounds (GBP) or $1.3 million, will be invested in cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), and ripple (XRP), the report notes.

The new survey included more than 700 deVere clients as respondents, located in major global countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, Qatar, Switzerland, Mexico, Hong Kong, Spain, France, Germany and South Africa and the United Arab Emirates.

DeVere founder and CEO Nigel Green has outlined five major factors that drive global high-net-worth individuals to keep an eye on crypto, not including the Fear Of Missing Out, or FOMO.

According to Green, the first major reason is that cryptocurrencies are borderless, which enables the asset to be available everywhere all over the globe.

The other factors include the fact that crypto suits the general global trend of increasing digitalization, the capability of crypto to provide solutions for real-life issues such as international remittances and providing services for the world’s assessed two billion person unbanked population, as well as acceptance by the younger generation and the active involvement by institutional investors.

Yesterday, the U.S.-based asset management firm Fidelity Investments released a new survey finding that 22% of institutional investors already own digital assets.
