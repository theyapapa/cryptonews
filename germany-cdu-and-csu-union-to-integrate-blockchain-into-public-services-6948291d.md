In Germany, the CDU and CSU Union wants to integrate blockchain technology into public services, Cointelegraph’s German-language version reported on June 25.

The CDU and CSU Union represents the centre-right Christian democratic political alliance of two parties in Germany, the Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU) and Christian Social Union in Bavaria (CSU).

In the original announcement published earlier today, the Union revealed that it wants to use blockchain for public service tasks such as administrative services, electronic health records, document protection, and registration.

Specifically, the CDU and CSU Union proposed the creation of a new form of company, which should be linked to an alternative commercial register.

The blockchain experts of the CDU and CSU parliamentary group and deputy parliamentary group leader Nadine Schön also support the development of a state cryptocurrency.

The new positions of the CDU and CSU parliamentary group are likely to be reflected at least in part in the Federal Government's blockchain strategy, which is scheduled for launch this year.

An article published by the CDU and CSU in April envisaged legislative changes to the blockchain area and a pro-innovation approach.
