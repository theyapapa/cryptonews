# Top 5 Crypto Performers Overview: Stellar, Ripple, NEO, Cardano, EOS ...

###### 2018-10-21 11:10

Letâ€™s look at the top five digital currencies with a market capitalization of $1 billion or more, which have risen the most in the past seven days.

## XLM/USD

Stellar bagged the pole position by gaining about 15 percent in the past seven days.

It has repeatedly failed to hold on to the support levels and has been making new lows at regular intervals.

## NEO/USD

NEO celebrated the second anniversary of their mainnet launch and the market cheered the event by pushing the price higher by 5 percent in the past seven days.

A break out of this level might start a new rally to $43, and above that to $60, where it might face resistance from the 50-week SMA.

Cardano has shrugged off the infighting as the price went up by about 5 percent in the past seven days.

This is the second attack within 60 days but the traders have shrugged off this news and the digital currency is up 3 percent in the past seven days.
