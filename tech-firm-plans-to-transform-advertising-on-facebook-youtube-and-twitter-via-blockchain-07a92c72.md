Atayen has created a decentralized application based on the Smart Advertisement Transaction Token (SaTT), which means that the objectives of an ad are woven into a smart contract.

The DApp independently measures the number of user interactions with advertising content, and as soon the goals agreed upon between the advertiser and publisher are met, the DApp releases the payment in SaTT to the publisher.

## Transparency in ad sales

Gauthier Bros, Atayen’s co-founder, sees this app as a herald of the “transparency revolution” in online advertising.

Atayen’s DApp is coded in the Solidity language and allows parties to set a range of conditions that trigger the release of advertising payments to the publisher.

Being an enabler of a pay-per-result model for any conceivable advertising vehicle, Atayen’s ad tech aims to allow publishers to charge higher, but more justifiable rates.

Bros, who is also Atayen’s CEO, says:

“Oracles feed the transactions, which can be a number of clicks, a number of views, a number of leads.

## Token liquidity

SaTT is required to buy and sell advertising transactions in Atayen’s DApp.
