# How Blockchain Could Change the Real Estate Investment Landscape ...

An increasing number of countries have begun the process of implementing functional and legal frameworks to regulate blockchain-recorded tokens over the past several months, which has led to increasing exploration of these technologies across many investment sectors.

Further, the use of distributed ledger technology (DLT) is a powerful disruptor at the transactional level, where significant disintermediation is occurring — especially with one of the most popular alternative investments: real estate.

For example, recent regulatory movements include:

- In July 2018, Malta passed into law the world's first legislative framework for blockchain and DLT with the purpose of regulating ICOs and STOs, including a benchmark regulatory platform and process.

As many groups are seeking to fine-tune and standardize definitions of the different types of tokens, much of this regulation recognizes that STOs — which, unlike most ICOs, are backed by physical assets — could be the solution to security and fraud concerns surrounding ICOs and other types of crypto tokens.

Since this class of investment was previously only accessible to high-net-worth investors, real estate investment trusts (REITs), opportunity funds, investment vehicles managed by major banks, or institutional investors, the tokenization of investment-grade assets into FRE significantly lowers the barrier of entry, priced at single token value with no traditional minimum investment limits or lock-in periods — creating a simpler and more secure opportunity for investors to buy in to.

## Data

Another way that the real estate investment and transaction landscape is changing due to blockchain technologies is the use of DLT to create public, state and federal government blockchains for all types of real estate-related databases, which increases accessibility, reduces rework, simplifies transactional procedures and reduces time frames.

## Universal regulatory acceptance

While there is still a long way to go when it comes to universal regulatory acceptance — for example, China, India and several other countries have banned STOs outright in recent years — crypto tokens and DLT are changing investment processes in major real estate markets around the world.
