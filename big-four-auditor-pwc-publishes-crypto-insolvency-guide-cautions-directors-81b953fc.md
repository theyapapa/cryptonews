# Big Four Auditor PwC Publishes Crypto Insolvency Guide, Cautions Directors ...

Big Four audit and consultancy firm PwC Hong Kong has published guidance for financially distressed or insolvent businesses in the crypto sector.

PwC notes that the two parameters used to determine a company’s financial viability — cash flow and balance sheet assessment — may be more difficult to ascertain in the case of crypto assets, whose volatility complicates a clear-cut valuation.

Once a company’s financial standing is in jeopardy, the auditor notes, directors’ duties shift from serving the best interests of their shareholders to those of their creditors, which become paramount.

The document outlines the possible loss of management control, civil penalties, and even criminal charges a director risks if they fail to adequately manage insolvency proceedings.

PwC cautions that where relationships between major creditors and directors have broken down, “a disgruntled creditor may take enforcement action to initiate formal insolvency proceedings \[...\] and to appoint a liquidator.”

PwC specifically addresses firms that operate in multiple jurisdictions, which the auditor contends is a common case for the crypto industry.

As reported, now-shuttered Canadian crypto exchange QuadrigaCX is currently the focus of legal proceedings and controversies following the death of its CEO in December 2018, which allegedly left the firm unable to access the majority of its crypto assets.
