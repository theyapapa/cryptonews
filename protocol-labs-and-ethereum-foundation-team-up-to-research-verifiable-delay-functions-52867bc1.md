# Protocol Labs and Ethereum Foundation Team Up to Research Verifiable Delay Functions ...

Filecoin owner Protocol Labs is collaborating with the Ethereum Foundation to develop a Verifiable Delay Function (VDF).

VDFs are a relatively new cryptographic primitive that can protect systems relying on the generation of (pseudo) random values from manipulation strategies or attack.

Examples of everyday use cases include picking a lottery winner on the blockchain, as VDFs could help stop miners from intervening with a block hash to win the jackpot.

Protocol Labs says additional research is required to make them more robust, as it is still possible for malicious actors with custom hardware to break the security of the protocols that depend on VDFs.

Protocol Labs and the Ethereum Foundation are planning to evaluate and co-fund grants to research the feasibility of developing optimized hardware for running a VDF.

In February, the Ethereum Foundation had denied that it was planning to spend $15 million on the development of VDFs for use in its transition to a proof-of-stake network.

The amount of money to be spent in the development of VDFs with this new partnership is not disclosed.
