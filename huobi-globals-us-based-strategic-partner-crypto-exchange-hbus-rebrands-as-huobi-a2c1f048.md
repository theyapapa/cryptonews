# Huobi Global’s US-Based Strategic Partner Crypto Exchange HBUS Rebrands as Huobi ...

###### 2019-01-11 09:01

HBUS, the United States-based strategic partner of China-born crypto exchange Huobi, has announced the rebranding of its retail trading service from HBUS.com to Huobi.com.

As reported, HBUS launched as a strategic partner of Huobi Group — the operator of the flagship Huobi Global crypto exchange — via a newly created San Francisco-based company “HBUS Holdco, Inc.” last June.

As well as officially adopting the Huobi brand name, HBUS is now reportedly set to benefit from an increased level of technological support from Huobi Global, specifically in regard to stability and security features, as well as securing access to new market makers.

The group first revealed plans to open an office in San Francisco in January 2018; following the announcement of HBUS in June, the U.S.-based partner trading service went live in July.

In 2018, Huobi also launched an Australian crypto trading platform, opened an office in London, and acquired controlling stock interest in a Hong Kong Stock Exchange-listed firm, as well as Japanese FSA-licensed crypto exchange BitTrade.

An Exchange Volumes Report from data researchers at the Blockchain Transparency Institute (BTI) last December implicated Huobi and fellow exchange HitBTC in alleged wash trading practices to artificially inflate volumes— although the evidence for both exchanges was found to be less significant than for rival exchange OKEx.

Huobi is currently ranked fourth largest crypto exchange on CoinMarketCap by adjusted traded volume, seeing around $519 million in trades over the 24 hours before press time.
