# Crypto Wallet Startup Ledger Detects Phishing Malware Targeting Desktop App ...

###### 2019-04-26 15:04

Hardware cryptocurrency wallet manufacturer Ledger has detected malware targeting its desktop application, according to a tweet on April 25.

Ledger warned its users that the malware locally replaces the Ledger Live desktop app with a malicious one, and advised to follow security practices published on its blog.

The company’s Twitter announcement specifically reads:

“WARNING: we’ve detected a malware that locally replaces the Ledger Live desktop application by a malicious one.

In the comments to the post, Ledger revealed that the malware is infecting only Windows machines, although the company has reportedly detected only one affected device.

While the team used this vulnerability to play the game Snake on the device, one member of the team that found the exploit claimed:

“We can send malicious transactions to the ST31 \[the secure chip\] and even confirm it ourselves \[via software,\] or we can even go and show a different transaction \[not the one that is actually being sent\] on the screen.”

The team also demonstrated that they found a vulnerability in the Ledger Blue, the most expensive hardware wallet produced by the company, that comes with a color touchscreen.

The reason Ledger said that the vulnerability was not critical is that “they did not succeed to extract any seed nor PIN on a stolen device” and “sensitive assets stored on the Secure Element remain secure.”
