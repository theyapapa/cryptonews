# Single Global Currency Like BTC Faces Insurmountable Obstacles, Argues Payments Firm CEO ...

Scott Galit, CEO of New York-headquartered payments processing firm Payoneer, says a single global, non-fiat currency such as Bitcoin (BTC) is unrealistic.

Galit built his argument against frictionless commerce, money and avoiding fiat currencies becoming a reality on two main points — the opposition of national governments and the concerns of central banks, with a focus primarily on the United States context.

In regard to the former, he argued that governments’ reliance on taxation for their revenue means that they will resist allowing residents to meet their tax obligations in a highly volatile currency such as Bitcoin.

He claimed that if fiat currency experienced the same degree of volatility as crypto, no government would be able to meet their financial obligations and ultimately be able to fund services for their residents.

As CNBC notes, in the U.S. context, some state governments have become less reluctant to interact with the world of cryptocurrencies of late — Ohio became the U.S.’s first to allow its residents to pay certain taxes in Bitcoin.

Nonetheless, the bottom line of this interaction is that the Bitcoin is first converted into fiat currency via the state’s OhioCrypto.com portal before it reaches government pockets.

This May, Jack Dorsey — the CEO of stalwart social media platform Twitter as well as Bitcoin-supporting payments firm firm Square — stated his view that “the internet deserves a native currency,” placing virtual currencies at the centre of his vision of a future, frictionless means of global payment.
