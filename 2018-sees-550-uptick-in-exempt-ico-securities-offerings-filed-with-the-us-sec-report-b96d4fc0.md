2018 witnessed a significant uptick in the number of initial coin offerings (ICOs) authorized by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to sell securities to large-scale investors, according to financial news channel MarketWatch, Jan. 11.

Their research reportedly found 287 results for evidently ICO-related fundraisings that were accepted by the agency to offer securities under what is known as a Form D exemption.

Form D is essentially a short registration form in which a company discloses essential information for prospective investors in its securities issuance.

The form is notably much shorter that the lengthy reports that are required ahead of sales of a non-exempt security to U.S. investors.

Exempt securities are notably limited for sale to so-called accredited investors only — defined in the U.S. as either individuals with a net worth of over $1 million, or who have consistently made $200,000+ per year in income, or as enterprises with over $5 million in assets.

According to MarketWatch, the 287 ICOs registered in 2018 under a Form D exemption had a combined declared value of $8.7 billion — considerably higher than in 2017, during which 44 ICOs reportedly registered for the exemption, at a combined declared value of $2.1 billion.

MarketWatch’s data found that Form D filings peaked in Q2 2018 — during which 99 ICOs were allegedly registered — with 87 in Q1, and lower numbers of 53 and 48 in Q3 and Q4 respectively.
