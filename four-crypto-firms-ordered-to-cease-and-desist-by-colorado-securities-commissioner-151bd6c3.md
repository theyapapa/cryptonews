Colorado State Securities Commissioner Gerald Rome has issued a cease and desist order to four Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) for allegedly offering unregistered securities, according to an official notice published Nov. 8.

On Nov. 8, Rome signed four orders to Bitcoin Investments, Ltd. — which is also conducting business as DB Capital — PinkDate, Prisma, and Clear Shop Vision Ltd.

The company reportedly claimed that “the average registered investment return over a two month period in 2017 was an amazing 95 percent,” while its ICO lists a number of celebrity promoters.

“Anonymously-operated, worldwide escorting service\[s\]” company Pinkdate allegedly seeks to fundrise more than $5 million via an ICO in tokens referred to as PinkDate Platform (PDP).

As for Prisma, its website allegedly requires users to buy its native crypto Prismacoin (PRIS) to use a proposed lending and arbitraging investment platform, through which investors could ostensibly profit up to 27 percent on their initial investment.

The last company on the list, Clear Shop Vision, Ltd, has promoted three ICOs since June 2018 and offered “ORC Token” with a “serious appreciation potential.”

The company’s site allegedly directs investors to send ETH directly to Clear Shop’s ETH wallet, but not through a crypto exchange.
