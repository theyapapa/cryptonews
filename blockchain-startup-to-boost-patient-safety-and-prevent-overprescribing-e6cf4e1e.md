# Blockchain Startup to Boost Patient Safety and Prevent Overprescribing ...

A blockchain solution has unveiled bold plans to make the United Kingdom’s medicine market safer by creating a system that prevents patients from ordering the same prescription from multiple pharmacies while stopping counterfeit drugs from making their way into the supply chain.

A lack of data sharing means patients can make multiple prescription orders across several websites in a matter of minutes — an issue of concern for regulators given the growing levels of drug dependency and addiction in the U.K. MediConnect says that, when it comes to opioid painkillers, patients could end up in possession of potentially lethal quantities of the drug in a short space of time, and a lack of control mechanisms means that all of this could take place daily, without a coordinated duty of care.

MediConnect hopes that its solution can improve patient outcomes, prevent drug misuse, establish where medicines have come from, and ensure that product recalls can happen more efficiently.

To achieve its vision, MediConnect’s blockchain is going to be powered by Stratis, whose in-house developers are being tasked with building a suite of services tailored to the needs of pharmacies.

MediConnect’s system would guarantee the visibility and transparency of drug circulation in the online pharmacy industry on both sides.

By the end of 2019, MediConnect will go on to deliver the results of the trial to the appropriate government regulators and the official Prescription Drug Addiction working group within the BBFA, the Care Quality Commission and the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency.

Dexter Blackstock, Mediconnect Director said:

“We need to influence change with regulators and our vision is that one day it will be mandatory for all pharmacies and prescribers to be using a single distributed ledger to prevent the misuse, overprescribing and potential dependency of prescription drugs.”
