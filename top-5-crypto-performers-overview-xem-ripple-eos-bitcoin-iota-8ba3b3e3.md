At the start of the year, the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies was above $828 billion and many expected it to touch $1 trillion.

After the recent collapse, many analysts have forecast a further fall in prices and expect Bitcoin to bottom out around $3,000 or even $1,500.

## XEM/USD

NEM (XEM) is the best performer among the top cryptocurrencies in the past seven days, though it has slumped about 18 percent, showing bear dominance across markets.

Though the bears succeeded in breaking down the range, they are struggling to sustain prices at lower levels.

The remainder can be added at higher levels as the digital currency starts a new uptrend.

However, this year, the digital currency is in a firm bear grip and is struggling to hold on to support levels.

On the other hand, if the price recovers from the current levels and rises above $0.4037, the digital currency might consolidate for a few weeks before attempting to start a new uptrend.
