Germany’s largest bank, Deutsche Bank, has joined JPMorgan’s blockchain-based network, the Interbank Information Network (IIN).

## Two years in operation

Launched as a pilot in 2017, the JPMorgan-led blockchain initiative now has a network of 320 banks that have entered the platform to swap global payments data using the Ethereum network, the Financial Times reported on Sept. 15.

Takis Georgakopoulos, head of payments at JPMorgan, expressed hope that Deutsche Bank will be the first of several other large banks to join IIN.

IIN will enable Deutsche Bank to offer better client services, according to the bank’s global head of cash management Ole Matthiessen.

Matthiessen, who occupied the position in March 2019, explained that the bank expects IIN to reduce the cost of processing difficult payments.

## 400-member target by year’s end

The IIN network is based on the JPMorgan-developed Quorum platform and intends to tackle the major challenges of sharing information between banks and speed up transactions to recipients.

According to Georgakopoulos, JPMorgan aims to reach 400 agreements with banks by the end of 2019 and is also expecting to announce other large banks in the near future.
