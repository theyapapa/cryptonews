In a transaction that has all the hallmarks of a reverse initial public offering (IPO) — also called a reverse merger — OKC Holdings Corp., which is the parent company of OKCoin and OKEx (the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume) bought a controlling share in Leap Holdings Group on Jan. 14.

On Aug. 21, 2018, cryptocurrency exchange Huobi Global bought a controlling share in Pantronics Holdings Ltd., an electronics manufacturing company.

## Reverse IPO explained

The goal of a private company entering into a reverse merger is to get listed on an exchange — i.e., to go public — without going through the complexities and regulatory intricacies of an official IPO.

## The benefits of a reverse IPO for crypto companies

Getting listed through a reverse merger is much cheaper and a lot quicker than the traditional IPO path.

They crave more transparency, and a reverse IPO would raise the crypto company’s profile in their eyes by becoming public.

Finally, a reverse merger can help a crypto company gain access to a different market by acquiring a controlling share in a shell company that is located in a different country.

The share price of Leap Holdings Group Ltd. dropped more than 53 percent from HK$0.39 ($0.05) to HK$0.18 ($0.023) per share since its reverse IPO with OKC Holdings Corp, while Novogratz’ Galaxy Digital suffered similar losses, from 2.30 Canadian dollars ($1.75) per share price in August 2018 to CA$1.38 ($1.05) per share at the end of January 2019 — a drop of 40 percent.
