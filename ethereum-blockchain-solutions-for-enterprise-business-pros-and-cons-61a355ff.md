Its prospective blockchain protocol is one of the few cryptocurrency projects actually achieving real-world adoption, with dozens of applications that can be divided into 11 major categories: open finance, decentralized exchanges, gaming, collectibles, marketplaces, developer tools, identity, governance, infrastructure, token-curated registries and Ethereum Request for Comments (ERC) token standards.

## Real-world Ethereum adoption

Out of the 2,000+ cryptocurrencies out there, Ethereum has demonstrated how a blockchain technology can achieve real-world adoption with both individuals and enterprise businesses.

At the forefront of Ethereum enterprise adoption is the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, a blockchain consortium with over 450 enterprise business members, including Microsoft, JPMorgan Chase, Santander, Accenture, ING, Intel, Cisco and others.

This protocol is a privacy tool based on the zk-SNARKs protocol that enables large corporates and enterprises that require blockchain privacy to build upon the public Ethereum network.

Also, enterprises can now achieve privacy on the public Ethereum blockchain with Ernst & Young’s Nightfall protocol.

All in all, Ethereum’s interoperability essentially keeps enterprise blockchains up to date, as it offers them global reach, an expansive network of users and DApps, and continuous developments and upgrades.

Competition: While Ethereum is leading the way in enterprise blockchain adoption, it is competing with other blockchain protocols that claim to be more scalable than Ethereum.
