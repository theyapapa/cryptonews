Such differing opinions can confuse new investors who are looking to enter the crypto markets.

It is only a matter of time before the bear market ends and a new bull phase begins.

## TRX/USD

Tron (TRX) was the best performing cryptocurrency among the largest coins by market cap over the past week.

Long-term investors can expect the cryptocurrency to start a new uptrend if the price sustains above $40.784.

## BNB/USD

Binance Coin (BNB) has made giant strides in the past few weeks and is now ranking 12th largest coin by market capitalization.

The crypto exchange Gemini chose to list Dash instead of Monero because its founders, the Winklevoss Twins believe that the regulators would be more favorable to Dash.

On the other hand, a break out of the range can propel the cryptocurrency to the overhead resistance at $81.
