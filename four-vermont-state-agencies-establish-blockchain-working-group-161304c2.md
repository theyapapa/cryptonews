Four agencies of the state government of Vermont in the United States have jointly formed a working group to study blockchain technology, according to an announcement published Dec. 10.

The group will purportedly address three core issues, including the opportunities, challenges, and concerns surrounding blockchain technology, the necessity of blockchain-specific regulation, and ways to protects customers who deploy the technology or are affected by it.

Attorney General Donovan stated that the group will enable state regulatory agencies to better understand blockchain and determine how to engage with “a technology that may represent a new business sector.”

Over the last year, administrations of other U.S. states have also established blockchain working groups.

This summer, Connecticut governor Dannel Malloy signed SB 443 into law, which established a blockchain working group to study the technology.

California’s AB 2658, a bill that calls for the establishment of a working group on blockchain technology, passed both houses of the state legislature in August, and was subsequently signed into law by the governor in late September.

In March, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) created a blockchain working group to identify and target fraudulent schemes which affect the FTC’s consumer protection and competition missions.
