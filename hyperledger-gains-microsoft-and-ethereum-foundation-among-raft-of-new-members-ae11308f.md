Microsoft, Salesforce and the Ethereum Foundation are among the major new companies joining enterprise blockchain platform Hyperledger.

Part of a monthly update on new members of Hyperledger, Behlendorf said June’s rollout included the Ethereum Foundation as a non-profit member, while supply chain standards body GS1 is also now on board.

Hosted by the Linux Foundation, Hyperledger already counts IBM, JPMorgan Chase, Deutsche Boerse and others among its participants.

“It shows the expanding footprint that we have out there in terms of not only concentrating on the core which has been the use of Hyperledger Fabric,” Behlendorf told Cointelegraph.

Continuing, Behlendorf noted Salesforce — which offers a range of cloud-based software solutions for businesses — was joining on the back of releasing its software-as-a-service product built on Hyperledger late last month.

The company already has a partnership with the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance, he added, making it a natural step for the Ethereum Foundation to join as part of efforts to become closer to the largest altcoin’s community.

Other companies will also join Hyperledger at the same time, with full details due in the formal announcement.
