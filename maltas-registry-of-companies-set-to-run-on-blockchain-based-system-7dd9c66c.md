Malta’s Registry of Companies is going to be run on a blockchain-powered system, local news outlet the Malta Independent reported on May 8.

The agency demerged from the Malta Financial Services Authority’s (MFSA) and established itself as a separate entity at the end of last year.

According to the Malta Independent, the new agency will be run on a blockchain-based system.

It will be run by a system which will handle all of the processes performed by the Registry of Companies.

The new system will make possible the provision of new services which with the present system are not being provided bringing the agency the first in the world to be run on a blockchain based system."

Namely, the document cites “education, transport, mobility, shipping, Land Registry, customs, company registry, and healthcare” as services which can be improved with the technology.

Later in January, a mission from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) judged that the growth of blockchain in Malta had created significant risks of money laundering and terrorism financing in the island’s economy.
