###### 2019-03-24 08:03

Amazon-owned streaming service Twitch has evidently removed Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) as payment options for subscriptions.

The user noted that Twitch had offered an option to pay with BTC and BCH employing BitPay as a payment processor, but has since “removed it in the last couple of weeks as a payment method for all countries.”

One user, seemingly outraged, noted that they canceled all of their Twitch subscriptions and sent an assistance ticket to the company.

On March 20, another Reddit user claimed that Streamlabs — a popular streaming software widely used by Twitch users to receive tips — also removed support for cryptocurrency.

According to the user, a new version of the software that has been recently released no longer contains support for crypto donations.

In June 2018, major travel booking website Expedia.com confirmed to Cointelegraph that it had also stopped accepting Bitcoin as a payment method for hotels or flights.

As Cointelegraph reported in August 2016, Twitch previously offered Bitcoin as a payment option using Coinbase as a payment processing gateway.
