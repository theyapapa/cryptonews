# Open Letter From Ripple Asks US Gov’t For Fair Crypto Regulation ...

Blockchain payment network Ripple signed an open letter to United States regulators on July 28 ahead of fresh hearings on cryptocurrency regulation this week.

In the wake of mixed feelings from Congress on both Facebook’s Libra digital currency and crypto more broadly, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse appealed to Washington to be lenient in its future approach.

The letter, which follows other recent concerns from Garlinghouse, begins:

“Many in the blockchain and digital currency industry are responsible actors.

The company and its executives have meanwhile often found themselves at the center of controversy in the cryptocurrency world, due mainly to questions surrounding Ripple’s relationship to XRP and disputes over its decentralization.

In the letter, Garlinghouse appeared to continue that tone, unveiling rare praise of central banks and government monetary policy — something which Bitcoin (BTC) specifically was designed to counter.

Garlinghouse continued:

“We don’t take for granted the vital role of central banks in issuing currencies and setting monetary policy in concert with the complex dynamics of economies around the world.

Concluding, Garlinghouse said the country was in the international spotlight over its response to the innovative sector:

“We urge you to support regulation that does not disadvantage U.S. companies using these technologies to innovate responsibly, and classifies digital currencies in a way that recognizes their fundamental differences — not painting them with a broad brush.”
