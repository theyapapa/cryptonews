Cryptocurrency exchange Binance will open trading of two pairs using Ripple (XRP) as the quote currency, a blog post confirmed Dec. 24.

Set to launch the same day, the TRX/XRP (Tron) and XZC/XRP (Zcoin) pairs represent the first time for Binance to use XRP as the base currency.

“We will be adding a couple trading pairs with XRP as the quote currency shortly,” CZ had confirmed on Twitter Sunday.

Earlier this month, developers launched a subsequently delayed range of pairs using USD-pegged stablecoin asset TrueUSD (TUSD) as the quote currency.

Commenting on the future token pair listing policy, Zhao said assets whose developers had contributed to Binance’s Blockchain Charity Foundation would receive more favorable consideration.

XRP jumped almost 20 percent on the news, taking XRP/USD to $0.44 at press time, a one-month high.

As of press time, Binance itself is the largest crypto exchange in the world by adjusted daily trade volume, seeing over $1.2 billion in trades over the last 24 hours.
