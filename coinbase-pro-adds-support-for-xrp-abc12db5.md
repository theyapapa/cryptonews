Coinbase Pro, the professional offering of United States-based crypto trading platform and wallet service Coinbase, is adding support for Ripple’s XRP token.

Per the announcement Coinbase Pro will now accept deposits of XRP for a minimum of 12 hours before enabling full trading.

Coinbase notes that it will first establish sufficient liquidity on the platform, opening trading pairs in U.S. dollars, euro and Bitcoin (BTC) in phases.

The first two stages will enable users to transfer XRP to Coinbase Pro accounts and post limit orders, the subsequent two will allow customers to match limit orders and fully trade with XRP.

Support for the aforementioned tokens was later expanded to Coinbase’s retail platform Coinbase.com and its mobile app.

The addition of XRP to Coinbase has been long-awaited by the crypto community.

In January 2018, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong quashed rumors that the exchange was added support for XRP in the short term.
