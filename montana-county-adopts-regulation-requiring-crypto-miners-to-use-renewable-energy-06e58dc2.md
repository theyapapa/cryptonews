The United States county of Missoula, in the state of Montana, has adopted regulation for cryptocurrency mining, local media outlet the Missoulian reports on April 5.

Per the report, the Missoula County Board of Commissioners voted unanimously to impose new rules for local cryptocurrency mining operations.

The focus of the new law is seemingly on the possible effects of cryptocurrency mining on global warming and electronic waste.

Another new rule established in the county requires miners to use exclusively renewable energy.

Lastly, preexisting mining operations that aren’t compliant will be allowed to continue but won’t be authorized for expansion if they don’t conform with the new regulations.

The Missoulian notes that the county’s staff claim mining company Hyperblock currently uses as much electricity as one-third of all homes in the county and plans to triple its power usage.

As Cointelegraph reported earlier today, the secretary of Hong Kong’s Financial Services and the Treasury has stated that crypto mining operations are regulated by local trading law.
