Oman’s second largest bank by market value, BankDhofar, has begun using RippleNet technology for cross-border payments to India.

RippleNet is a global blockchain-based payment network of institutional payment providers, that was developed by technology company Ripple.

Per the recent announcement, BankDhofar has become the first bank in the country and one of the first in the region to adopt RippleNet.

The technology enables the bank to provide cross-border transfers via a mobile banking application “in less than 2 minutes,” thus allowing non-resident Indians living in Oman to conduct real-time payment transfers.

Earlier this month, Finablr, a global payment platform and foreign exchange operator based in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), joined the RippleNet network to complete real-time transactions to Thailand.

Last December, the National Bank of Kuwait (NBK) also launched a cross-border remittance product based on RippleNet’s blockchain technology.

NBK reportedly become the first financial establishment in Kuwait to implement a remittance product — “NBK Direct Remit” — for international live payments based on RippleNet.
