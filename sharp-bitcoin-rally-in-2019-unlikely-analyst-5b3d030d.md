The chance of Bitcoin (BTC) recovering to its former five-digit highs this year is unlikely, a trading expert told MarketWatch on March 29.

Options trading — which allows traders to bet on whether the price of an asset will reach a certain level — has reportedly been gaining traction in the cryptocurrency space.

Emmanuel Goh, a former JPMorgan Chase derivatives trader and founder of crypto data firm Skew, told MarketWatch that daily volume in the crypto options market has doubled since the beginning of the year.

This means that, according to options traders, there is a five percent chance that Bitcoin will reach $10,000 by September.

Goh also noted that there is even a $20,000 call option for June, but the probability of Bitcoin hitting that price is zero.

Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of cryptocurrency trading platform BitMEX, recently predicted that Bitcoin will return to $10,000 this year, with $20,000 being the “ultimate recovery.”

Amid last year’s crash, billionaire and venture capitalist Tim Draper said that Bitcoin will reach a whopping $250,000 by 2022.
