Two shareholders of major cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex said that they are not distressed by the allegations made about the exchange’s insolvency by the New York Attorney General.

In January last year, Zhao Dong, a shareholder of the exchange, claimed on microblogging platform Weibo that the balance of Bitfinex and tether (USDT) reserves was over $3 billion, over the current USDT circulating supply.

The balances were reportedly shown to Dong by Giancarlo Devasini, chief financial officer of Tether and Bitfinex.

Concerning the recent allegations against Bitfinex, CoinDesk wrote that Devasini told Dong that Bitfinex “need\[s\] a few weeks and the funds will be unfrozen.”

The report also claims that Dong specified that the funds were in several banks in Poland, the United States and Portugal.

As Cointelegraph recently reported, Tether and Bitfinex published a joint statement on their respective blogs responding to the allegations that Tether’s funds were used to cover an $850 million loss at the crypto exchange.

Lastly, both Tether and Bitfinex — which share a CEO — had previously received subpoenas from U.S. regulators for still undisclosed reasons back in December 2017.
