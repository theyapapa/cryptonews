Switzerland-based blockchain and cybersecurity firm WISeKey has opened a Blockchain Center of Excellence in Geneva, according to an announcement on Feb. 1.

The Geneva Blockchain Center of Excellence will purportedly assist blockchain-related startups in addition to researching and promoting new technology.

Opening the center is part of a new partnership with the Blockchain Research Institute (BRI), which aims open up more centers in the United States, Latin America, China, India, and Africa.

The goal of the global blockchain centers is to coordinate with business, academia, and other centers and to share best practices and resources.

Last week, WISekey announced the opening of its Global Blockchain Center in Malaysia as part of a partnership with a subsidiary of Malaysian tech investment holding Censof.

On Jan. 23, WISeKey announced a blockchain-based identity partnership with the non-profit Race for Water Foundation, which aims to reduce ocean pollution using blockchain technology.

WISeKey will create a digital identity stored on its blockchain for every plastic product made by participating companies.
