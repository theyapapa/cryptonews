Zero Hash, a calculation and settlement agent and subsidiary of cryptocurrency platform Seed CX, has added support for derivatives.

According to a press release published on Sept. 11, Zero Hash now allows the settlement of bilateral derivatives transactions and supports settlement functions for forwards.

The newly released service provides collateral management for derivatives, including options such as “the calculation of variation margin, initial margin and final settlement values \[...\] the sending of margin-call notifications.”

## Expansion to new options

After procuring a virtual currency license from the United States Financial Crimes Enforcement Network in July, Zero Hash — which also received a money transmitter license — can now operate as a money transmitter for trading activity resulting from SCXM, which is its affiliated exchange.

Back in January, Seed CX also launched a digital asset wallet solution with on-chain settlement, developed together with Zero Hash.

## Growing interest in crypto derivatives

Earlier in September, major cryptocurrency exchange Binance showed growing interest in the cryptocurrency derivatives market by acquiring JEX, a crypto-asset trading platform that offers spot and derivatives trading services.

In August, Dutch crypto derivatives exchange Deribit and U.S.-based trading communication platform Paradigm jointly launched a block trading solution.
