BlockShow, an international blockchain event powered by Cointelegraph, has started a campaign to raise cryptocurrency for the Notre Dame cathedral reconstruction.

In the tweet, the team behind BlockShow revealed that it has initiated a fundraising campaign for the Notre Dame reconstruction following the devastating fire that engulfed the cathedral yesterday, April 15.

The BlockShow team posted two digital currency wallet addresses where everyone interested can transfer donations in both bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH), as well as a link to the Foundations Du Patrimoine, which is raising donations in fiat currencies.

National Public Radio (NPR) has reported about several other international campaigns raising funds for the cathedral rebuilding, including GoFundMe and La Fondation Avenir du Patrimoine à Paris.

News about the Notre Dame fire has drawn the attention of dozens of the world’s most prominent individuals.

Former president of the United States Barack Obama tweeted:

“Notre Dame is one of the world’s great treasures, and we’re thinking of the people of France in your time of grief.

Last December, a Dublin-headquartered startup dubbed AID:Tech teamed up with the Irish Red Cross to use blockchain technology in a new app that improves transparency for charitable donations.
