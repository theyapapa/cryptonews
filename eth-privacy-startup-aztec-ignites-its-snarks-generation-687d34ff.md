###### 2019-09-15 09:09

Ethereum (ETH) privacy startup Aztec announced the launch of its zero-knowledge succinct non-Interactive argument of knowledge (SNARKs) generation via a cryptographic ceremony called Ignition.

In a press release shared with Cointelegraph on Sept. 15 the startup also announced the closing of its latest round of investment with participation from A.Capital, Coinbase and Libertus Capital.

## A cryptographic ceremony

Per the release, the multi-party computation ceremony is meant “to generate a set of encrypted points which will be used to derive all future Aztec notes.”

## ZK-SNARKs

Zero-knowledge SNARKs allow to prove that a piece of information is true without revealing anything about it.

That being said, a major disadvantage is that SNARKs’ security depends on the secrecy of a seed — a huge, randomly generated number.

## Aztec receives more funding

Aztec also announced the closing of its latest round of investment, in which major cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase and venture capital funds A.Capital and Libertus Capital reportedly participated.

Aztec noted that this funding will be used to build various developer tools and “explore incorporation of the universal SNARK known as PLONK.”
