# “Cryptokicks”: What We Know About Nike’s Potential Gateway Into Crypto ...

A document filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) surfaced online earlier this week, revealing Nike’s intention to launch “cryptokicks” — which appears to be more than just a new line of sneakers.

The news about Nike’s “cryptokicks” trademark was originally broken by Josh Gerben, a trademark attorney in the U.S. who first described the application via Twitter on April 24.

Furthermore, the document also describes plans for “providing a digital currency or digital token for use by members of an online community,” and enabling transactions to be completed using “unconventional currency systems,” which implies that Nike might integrate cryptocurrencies into its burgeoning online marketing — last month, the company reported its digital business brought in more than $1 billion in quarterly sales for the first time, securing a whopping 36% rise from the same period a year ago.

In the application, Nike also explains how it wants to reserve the “cryptokicks” name for providing “online blogs in the field of crypto collectibles” and offering online computer games, such as scavenger hunts, treasure hunts and obstacle courses.

During his analysis of the document, Gerben also explained that the application was made on a “1B” basis, which means Nike has submitted a sworn statement indicating they intend to use the trademark in the near future.

However, Hinkes warns that Nike is unlikely to present any “cryptokicks” product in forthcoming months, as the overall process of securing a trademark is quite time-consuming:

“First, an applicant files their application for federal trademark protection.

During that 30-day objection period, those who have preexisting rights in the brank “cryptokicks” could prove that the acceptance of Nike's application for “cryptokicks” as a protected mark would cause consumer confusion and thus damage to their preexisting mark, Hinkes told Cointelegraph.
