The Finance Committee of the lower house of French parliament has adopted amendments to a tax bill that ease taxes on cryptocurrency sales, daily French newspaper Le Figaro reports Wednesday, Nov. 7.

The amendments adopted by Finance Committee of the National Assembly refer to a draft of the government finance bill (PLF) for 2019.

If the final version of the document is approved by a broader parliament, whose hearings are scheduled for next week, the tax on crypto sales will be equal to capital income tax.

The French government has actively adjusted legislation to accommodate new technologies, including digital currencies and blockchain.

In September, Mair announced that the government had accepted a legal framework for Initial Coin Offerings (ICO).

Under the new regulations, the French stock markets regulator Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) is empowered to issue licenses to companies that aim to raise funds via an ICO.

The bill contains some relevant changes for the French regulatory framework with regard to crypto assets and ICOs.
