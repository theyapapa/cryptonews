Distributed ledger technology (DLT) company Iota partners with auto manufacturer Jaguar Land Rover for a proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstration for tracing car energy with DLT.

Per the announcement, Iota is partnering with Jaguar Land Rover and French energy R&D center Engie Lab Crigen for the demonstration.

The demonstration aims to show the public both the source and use of a Jaguar I-Pace’s energy at the Trondheim Powerhouse, the building whose inauguration forms the background for the proof-of-concept.

Russell Vickers, the manager of Jaguar Land Rover’s vehicle-as-a-service engineering group, commented on what he believe this PoC suggests for the future of energy-conscious smart cities.

We are excited to let the public see how energy-positive buildings and vehicles such as the I-Pace in this demonstration can create positive sustainability innovation in line with Jaguar Land Rover’s Destination Zero strategy.”

## The Jaguar I-Pace’s Iota smart wallet

According to the report, the Jaguar I-Pace contains an Iota-backed smart wallet that could be used for energy-charging — a so-dubbed “Green Charging” feature — that is similarly traced by Iota’s DLT.

Additionally, the I-Pace’s smart wallet currently lets users earn IOTA by letting the car automatically report data relevant to road conditions, including information on potholes, weather and traffic, per the announcement.
