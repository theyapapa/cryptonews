A website that delivers live cryptocurrency prices and market capitalizations in visual form has unveiled a suite of updates and new features.

Coin360 displays the latest market movements for coins and tokens in proportionately sized blocks based on their market capitalizations.

Elsewhere on the main page, Coin360 users can switch tabs to assess the performance of major crypto exchanges.

A scrolling ticker at the bottom of the screen delivers the latest crypto news headlines from trusted sources — giving visitors live information about the current events that might be driving prices upward or downward.

The Liquidity Book provides users with insight into the best prices that are available for buying or selling cryptocurrencies.

Specific platforms can also be selected if a user wants to contrast its offering with rivals — making it ideal for discovering the smallest price a coin can be bought for and the highest price it can be sold.

Coin360 says its main motivation has been to deliver features that cannot be found elsewhere in the crypto industry, all while ensuring that visitors only see the information that’s relevant to them.
