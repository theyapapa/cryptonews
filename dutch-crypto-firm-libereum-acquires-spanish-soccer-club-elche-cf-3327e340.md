Dutch crypto firm Libereum has acquired Spanish soccer club Elche CF for $4.9 million, according to a press release published to the Libereum website Dec. 26.

The acquisition marks the first step in the crypto company’s ambitions to purchase a set of international soccer clubs and make its ERC20 token, Liber, a mandatory form of payment in the stadiums of those clubs it owns.

Libereum’s official statement yesterday outlines that the company aspires to restore the club to the Primera Division by bolstering the its financial resources through its Liber token economy:

“We want the \[Libereum token\] to gradually become part of the financial policy in and around the club, so that everything - on the term - can be paid simply, in an easily accessible way, with Liber.

According to Finance Magnates, Libereum has also this week hinted at an undisclosed deal to purchase another football club allegedly worth €80 million, although details of the purported acquisition are not accessible on the company site as of press time.

This August, seven United Kingdom premier league clubs — Tottenham Hotspur, Brighton & Hove Albion, Crystal Palace, Cardiff City, Leicester City Football Club, Newcastle United and Southampton — partnered with local crypto trading platform eToro to integrate blockchain and cryptocurrencies in soccer stadiums.

In September, French soccer club Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) — hailed as the country’s most popular team — announced its partnership with blockchain platform Socios.com to launch a token ecosystem.

Just this month, Brazilian premier league soccer club Atletico Mineiro launched its own fan utility token dubbed “GaloCoin.”
