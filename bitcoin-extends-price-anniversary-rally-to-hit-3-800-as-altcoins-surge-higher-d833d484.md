In altcoin markets, it was Bitcoin Cash (BCH) which led the resurgence, the asset having previously fallen more precipitously than most, to trade well below its August 2017 issuing price.

Having climbed two places higher in the market cap rankings since Tuesday, BCH traded around $117 at press time, capping 33 percent daily gains.

Ethereum (ETH), formerly the largest altcoin by market cap before being overtaken by XRP, also managed to scrape into triple figures after falling to its lowest levels in 18 months.

ETH had shown itself to be highly susceptible to Bitcoin’s own volatility in recent weeks, at press time nonetheless gaining over 11 percent to hit $104.
