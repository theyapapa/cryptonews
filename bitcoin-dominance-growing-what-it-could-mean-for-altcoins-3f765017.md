Whether altseason returns or not, the only point for consonance appears to be the idea that the current bull cycle could have profound ramifications for the still infant market.

## Bitcoin vs. altcoins: The altcoin bubble argument

In late 2017, the cryptocurrency market arguably captured attention in the financial sector and beyond.

Bitcoin rose to almost eclipse the $20,000 price mark while altcoins also posted all-time highs.

This method requires using the BTC price as the baseline for measuring altcoin price-performance within a specific time period, and the results appear even more dire for altcoins.

Twitter user and Blockstream developer named Grubles, tweeting on Monday (July 16, 2019), delivered a damning indictment on altcoin value proposition, declaring:

“’Altseason’ was just a flash in the pan caused by Bitcoin miners delaying a protocol upgrade and massively profiting from altcoin mining.

For crypto bulls like John McAfee, the altcoin market isn’t dead in the water and the current price slide only represents an opportunity for savvy investors to reap the rewards of another altcoin boom having earned returns from Bitcoin’s bullish advance.
