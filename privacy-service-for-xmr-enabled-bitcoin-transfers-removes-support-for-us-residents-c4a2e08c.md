# Privacy Service for XMR-Enabled Bitcoin Transfers Removes Support for US Residents ...

###### 2019-04-01 04:04

XMR.to — a service that allows users to increase the privacy of their Bitcoin (BTC) transactions by using Monero (XMR) as an intermediary currency — has announced it will not be serving United States-based clients for the time being.

XMR.to allows users to make a Bitcoin payment to a specified address, but to maximize their own anonymity by first transferring an equivalent value in privacy coin Monero to XMR.to, which — after receiving the Monero — executes the Bitcoin payment on the user’s behalf.

Enforcing the newly-introduced jurisdictional restriction could pose a considerable challenge for XMR.to, given that its company policy currently tends towards protecting user confidentiality — not just from the public, but from the service itself.

The XMR.to website outlines that:

“No-one (including us) can link you to the \[XMR\] payment you send us.

The only other link to us is your IP address (from which you are visiting this webpage right now), which you should hide if you wish to protect your privacy to the full extent (see best practices below).”

onion address and outlines that users can maximize anonymity by using TOR (dark web) to fully conceal their IP address, location and identity.

Notably, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has claimed that despite challenges, the agency still has ways of tracking altcoins, including Monero.
