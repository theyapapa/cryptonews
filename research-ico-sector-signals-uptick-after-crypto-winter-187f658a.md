# Research: ICO Sector Signals Uptick After Crypto Winter ...

###### 2019-05-25 08:05

The data was revealed in a new report from token rating platform ICObench, shared with Cointelegraph on May 25.

85% of total funds raised so far in May reportedly belong to projects with a high (3-3.5) rating — as compared with 68% in April.

According to ICObench’s data, the number of published projects in May has increased by 157 to hit 5,512 projects, with 287 ongoing ICOs and 140 upcoming token sales expected.

The report notes that data for the total funds raised so far in May has been overwhelmed by the reported $1 billion initial exchange offering (IEO) from cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex — bringing the total amount of funds raised via token sales this month to roughly $1.075 billion.

As reported, an IEO represents an alternative model of token offering wherein a centralized crypto exchange operates the sales and ostensibly vets both the projects themselves and prospective investors.

Bitfinex’s major offering has resulted in May being the month with the highest total funds raised so far in 2019.

In ICObench’s historical data — which represents May 2018 through May 21, 2019 — only May and June 2018 saw higher levels of total funds raised via token sales.
