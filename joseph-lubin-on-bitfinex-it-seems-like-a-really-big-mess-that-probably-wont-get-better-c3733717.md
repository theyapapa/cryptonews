# Joseph Lubin on Bitfinex: It Seems Like a Really Big Mess That Probably Won’t Get Better ...

Joseph Lubin, founder of blockchain tech company ConsenSys, expressed his pessimism regarding the recent situation with cryptocurrency trading platform Bitfinex, Bloomberg reported on May 9.

Tether is somewhat important to our ecosystem because it’s used by different institutions to effect more fluid trading.”

Lubin noted however, that the turmoil surrounding Tether and Bitfinex could drive growth in other stablecoins:

“There are other price-stable tokens out there — many others — and I think they’re going to gain traction because of this.

As previously reported, in late April, the New York State Attorney General (NYAG) alleged that Bitfinex lost $850 million and subsequently used funds from affiliated firm Tether, that stands behind the eponymous stablecoin, to covertly cover the shortfall.

Shortly after, Tether and Bitfinex responded to the accusations with a statement claiming that court filings by the NYAG’s office were “riddled with false assertions.”

Tether has since confirmed preexisting rumors that its tokens did not have full dollar reserve backing, and was in fact only 74% backed by U.S. dollars and other reserves.

Last month, Cointelegraph reported that ConsenSys, Lubin’s firm, was trying to attract outside investors to raise $200 million.
