Public measures should be taken to ensure that blockchain’s potential as a groundbreaking infrastructure for the social economy is accessible to all.

This was the advice put forward by the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) in its new report devoted to blockchain, an EU Reporter article published on August 1 reveals.

## Blockchain recalls Europe’s epoch-making inventions

In key remarks accompanying its new report, the EESC says it would encourage European institutions to foster the involvement of more civil society organisations in the EU Blockchain Observatory and European Blockchain Partnership.

The successful implementation of new digital infrastructures based on blockchain, the Committee notes, is not purely a matter of technological development but “involves a fully-fledged process of disruptive social innovation.”

Looking beyond the technology’s roots in cryptocurrencies, EESC member and president of Cecop-Cicopa Europe, Giuseppe Guerini, compared the historic importance of blockchain to that of landmark inventions on the continent:

“We can draw parallels with the invention of the printing press.

## Preventing the emergence of a “digital divide”

The EESC has recognized a broad gamut of applications for blockchain in the social enterprise sector, including donations and fundraising for NGOs; the governance of social economy organizations; digitized, verifiable qualifications and diplomas; smart contract-powered intellectual property rights management; telemedicine and agriculture — to name just a few.

Back in February 2018, the European Commission launched the EU Blockchain Observatory and Forum, heralded as a major step toward uniting the EU economy around blockchain.
