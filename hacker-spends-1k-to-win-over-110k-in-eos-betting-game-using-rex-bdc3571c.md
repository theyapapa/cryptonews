## Biggest DeFi service EOS REX used

An alleged bug in EOSPlay allowed the attacker to steal 30,000 EOS via using EOS REX, a major decentralized financial (DeFi) service enabling EOS lending in exchange for extra CPU on the EOS blockchain, crypto-focused publication CryptoSlate reports Sept. 14.

As previously reported, EOS REX is the biggest DeFi platform by a comfortable margin, having 331 million in EOS placed on the platform at press time, according to DeFi.Review website.

Citing crypto entrepreneur Jared Moore, the report says that the hacker had to spend approximately 300 EOS ($1,200 at press time) to set up the attack, which involved a number of subsequent transactions indicating consecutive wins on the EOS decentralized application (DApp).

## Block.One CTO: EOS network not affected

Daniel Larimer, CTO at EOS developer company Block.One, tweeted that the hacking incident did not affect EOS network but rather caused a network overload resulting in no extra bandwidth available on a free basis.

Meanwhile, some users, including Moore himself, stated that the hack froze the EOS blockchain, claiming that the network was not usable for both DApps and wallet.

Another EOS user reported on CPU issues, suggesting that the network was under attack.

A user on Reddit pointed out that the network remained active despite the claims that the attack stopped the EOS blockchain for an hour, citing data from EOS block explorer Blocks.io.
