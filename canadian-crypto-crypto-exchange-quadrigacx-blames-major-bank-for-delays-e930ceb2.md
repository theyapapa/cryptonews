Canada’s largest digital currency exchange QuadrigaCX is blaming legal action from a major bank for delays when customers cash out funds, the Globe and Mail reported Oct. 8.

Quadriga reportedly states that it has been experiencing difficulties accessing $21.6 million of its funds since January when the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) froze five accounts belonging to the exchange’s payment processor, Costodian Inc., and its owner, Jose Reyes.

The bank purportedly froze the accounts due to an inability to identify the funds’ owners.

According to the Globe and Mail, CIBC requested the court to withhold the disputed funds and decide whether they belong to QuadrigaCX, Costodian, or the 388 users who had deposited the funds.

Quadriga subsequently told the court that the bank froze the funds mistakenly, and claims to be the undisputed owner of the greater part of the funds as there is “no evidence” of competing claims.

Quadriga said:

“This court should not succumb to the bank’s unsubstantiated and highly offensive speculation that there must be shady dealings afoot because Quadriga’s business is a trading platform for individuals trading in cryptocurrencies.”

According to the Globe and Mail, Quadriga has told the clients that banks in the Canada are “conspiring” against crypto businesses.
