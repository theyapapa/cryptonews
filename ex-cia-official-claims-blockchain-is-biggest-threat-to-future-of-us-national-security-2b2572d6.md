# Ex-CIA Official Claims Blockchain Is ‘Biggest Threat’ to Future of US National Security ...

Andrew Bustamante, reportedly a former CIA intelligence officer, has claimed blockchain is “super powerful stuff” that represents a threat to America’s national security.

He brought up blockchain in response to a question in a subreddit thread, on news aggregation site Reddit, dedicated to Bustamante’s “Everyday Espionage” — what he dubs an “integrated education and training platform that teaches international espionage tactics to benefit everyday life.”

One Redditor had asked Bustamante what he thought represents “the biggest threat to America \[sic\] national security in the coming years?”

While the ex-CIA official did not further elaborate on his remarks, he acknowledged one other Redditor’s response, who asked him for clarification in regard to blockchain versus developments in quantum computing — to which Bustamante responded with “fair point!!!”

Bustamante’s exclamation spawned a discussion of the possibility that quantum computing will “forever alter” the cryptographic protection that underpins blockchain — thus specifically attributing Bustamante’s “bring it down” to an argument along this vein.

One Redditor suggested his remarks could refer to “the persistent possibility of untraceable, anonymous transactions \[that\] can happen” on blockchains as being one type of national security threat allegedly posed by the technology.

Notably, the last time blockchain, alleged geopolitical machinations and the intelligence community made joint headlines was when the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) charged seven officers from Russia’s Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) with crypto-funded global hacking and related disinformation operations this October.
