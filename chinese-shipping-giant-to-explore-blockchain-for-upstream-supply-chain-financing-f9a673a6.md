China Shipbuilding Industry Company Limited (CSICL) is going to explore how it can apply blockchain to financing its upstream suppliers, reports official Chinese newspaper People’s Daily on March 27.

CSICL signed a strategic cooperation agreement on supply chain services with Shanghai Bank.

Per the terms of the agreement, CSICL and Shanghai Bank will purportedly develop an blockchain-based online supply chain finance platform for upstream suppliers of CSIC.

The platform would ostensibly provide financing for supply chains servicing the firm’s 10 major product sections: marine engineering, storage batteries, shipbuilding, turbochargers, tobacco machinery, diesel engines, large steel structure fabrications, port machinery, gas meters and automation distribution systems.

Last October, Shanghai Bank reportedly launched its Uplink e-Chain — an online supply chain financial service platform for small and medium enterprises.

Blockchain technology has been widely applied across the shipping industry and in various supply chains.

In January, Israel’s largest cargo shipping company, Zim, opened a blockchain platform for electronic bills of lading to all clients in selected trades.
