# Charles Hoskinson Thinks Cardano Will Prevail Over Libra in Emerging Markets ...

###### 2019-06-27 21:06

Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson claimed that emerging markets are where cryptocurrencies matter, and that Facebook’s announced virtual currency Libra is not going to find success in this area, according to a report by Finance Magnates on June 26.

He says:

“Emerging markets are where cryptocurrencies matter \[...\] When I look at the developed world, I don’t care.

In contrast, Hoskinson predicted a struggle for Facebook in promoting Libra due to its lack of relationships, which he said need to be built over time, based on tangible benefits specific to the emerging markets in question.

These are relationship-based markets – and Facebook doesn’t have those relationships.”

Nonetheless, as previously reported by Cointelegraph, Facebook’s stated aim with Libra is:

“Our ultimate goal is to help billions of people with access to things they don’t have now — that could be things like healthcare, equitable financial services, or new ways to save or share information.”

Other major industry players like Coinbase have made promoted crypto’s potential benefits to citizens in developing countries.

When the crypto exchange added support for 50 new jurisdictions in May, Coinbase made the following remark in its official announcement:

“For new customers in countries like Argentina and Uzbekistan, where consumer prices are expected to inflate by 10–20% in 2020, stablecoins like USDC could provide an opportunity to protect against inflation.”
