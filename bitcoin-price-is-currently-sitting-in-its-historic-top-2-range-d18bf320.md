# Bitcoin Price Is Currently Sitting in Its Historic Top 2% Range ...

###### 2019-08-09 10:08

Bitcoin has only spent 63 days in its history where it closed above current price.This was the factoid posted by crypto-analyst Ceteris Paribus on Aug. 6, along with comparative data for selected altcoins.

Which goes to show that despite unwarranted concerns from those who feel that BTC price should constantly be parabolic, Bitcoin is in rather rude health.

## 2 months of mayhem vs. a steady climb

Bitcoin has existed for 3870 days (3867 at the time of the tweet).

So if only 63 days closed higher than the price on Aug. 6, that means that we are currently in the top 2% of days for Bitcoin price ever.

The other days came much more recently, in June and July this year, when bitcoin made its assault on $13,000.

Binance coin (BNB) came top of the rest, with 76 days closing above the current price, although that is based on a shorter history than many others including Bitcoin.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH), XRP, and Ether (ETH) had all posted over 500 days on which they closed above the price that they were at on Aug. 6.
