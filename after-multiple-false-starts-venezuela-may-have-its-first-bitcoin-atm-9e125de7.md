According to data by Coin ATM Radar, Venezuela has finally gotten its very first Bitcoin ATM.

## Multiple attempts to install Bitcoin ATM

Venezuela’s first crypto ATM was installed on Sept. 10, in the city of San Antonio del Táchira, according to data by Coin ATM Radar, a website that facilitates the online search for the nearest Bitcoin ATM.

Apparently there have been previous attempts to install a Bitcoin ATM in Venezuela.

At the end of January, crypto firm Cryptobuyer announced the coming installation and testing of a new Bitcoin ATM in the city of Caracas.

That number is set to rise thanks to a partnership between the global peer-to-peer Bitcoin marketplace, Paxful, and Medellin-based blockchain company, CoinLogiq, who are bringing 20 new crypto ATMs to Colombia.

## 5400+ crypto ATMs installed worldwide

The world’s first Bitcoin ATM opened in Vancouver, Canada in late 2013.

According to statistics from Coin ATM Radar, the total number of crypto ATMs around the world went from 501 in 2016 to more than 5400 in 2019.
