# Crab War on Blockchain: Long-Time Developer Launches Its First Crypto Game ...

###### 2018-10-26 09:10

iCandy Interactive says CryptantCrab is a player versus player (PVP) game that offers “artistically designed crabs for players to collect, mutate, battle, and trade.”

Each CryptantCrab is unique and individual to the players – as well as tamper-proof – a concept that the developer believes will ensure the game is “uncheatable.”

In a blog post detailing the concept, the team behind CryptantCrab wrote: “The way the game looks, thanks to the stylized art and stunning designs used, makes it more desirable than other blockchain-powered collectibles.

## Presale launches

CryptantCrab has now launched a presale where gamers can get their hands on the collectibles used to play the game.

Successfully attacking another CryptantCrab brings trophies, while fending off a rival enables players to earn Cryptant – the game’s only resource that is used for mutations to take place and further enhance a crab’s capabilities.

iCandy Interactive, the company behind CryptantCrab, is based in Australia and has a portfolio of more than 340 games.

This blockchain-driven video game is a spin-off to Crab War, described as a highly successful mobile game that has gained fans across the world.
