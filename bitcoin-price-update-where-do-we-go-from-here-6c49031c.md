# Bitcoin Price Update: Where do we go from here? ...

Or, in simpler terms, a large seller threw up a buy wall to maintain Bitcoin price while unloading from their own stack.

There has also been an unusual number of large Bitcoin transfers taking place.

As a review, the Bollinger band indicator, Bitcoin Golden Ratio indicator and bearish Moving Average Divergence Convergence (MACD) all provided valuable insight into yesterday’s move.

While outside the pennant, $9,416 extends to the lower arm of the Bollinger Band indicator and BTC’s previous price action of consolidating within symmetrical triangles would dictate a touch at this point, then a journey back toward the upper Bollinger Band arm.

A less positive interpretation of yesterday’s price action would see Bitcoin drop below $9,400 and the lack of purchasing demand shown by the Volume Profile Visible Range (VPVR) could lead to BTC dropping to or below the 61.8% retracement level.

Top traders like Philip Swift, FilbFilb and WillyWoo suggest keeping a close eye on the 128-day moving average and the 20-week moving average as both have been effective indicators of when to accumulate Bitcoin.

Investor sentiment could also be weighing on Bitcoin price action as the assumption that Bitcoin will return to the $7,500 to $8,500 range continues to be a popular idea.
