# Ethereum’s Constantinople, St. Petersburg Upgrades Set to Occur This Week ...

Ethereum’s (ETH) next two network upgrades, referred to as Constantinople and St. Petersburg, are scheduled to take place this week, according to an official Ethereum blog post on Feb. 22.

Constantinople will bring the platform multiple efficiency improvements, as well as the delay of the so-called “difficulty bomb” and the decrease of Ethereum’s block reward.

The difficulty bomb is a feature meant to prevent miners from continuing their activity on the chain after Ethereum’s switch to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm.

However, since PoS implementation continues to be postponed, Ethereum developers had to delay the difficulty bomb to “make sure we don’t freeze the blockchain before proof of stake is ready & implemented.”

The Constantinople upgrade is thus set to delay the difficulty bomb — also referred to as the “ice age” — for approximately 12 months.

Constantinople also brings the Create2 function to the platform, which was at first rumored to introduce an attack vector to Ethereum.

In January, major United States cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase and Kraken became the latest to confirm support for Ethereum’s upgrade.
