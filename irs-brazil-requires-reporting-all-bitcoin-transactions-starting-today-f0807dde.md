###### 2019-08-01 11:08

Beginning today, Aug. 1, Brazil citizens are obligated to report on their crypto transactions with the country’s Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

## Entities in Brazil must report on all kinds of crypto transactions

As Cointelegraph Brazil reports today, transactions involving cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) must be reported to the IRS in accordance with rules established by Normative Instruction 1,888 introduced in May 2019.

The measure requires entities to provide monthly reports by the end of the month following the month when crypto-related transactions occurred, the report notes.

According to the rules, local crypto exchanges will have to inform the IRS about all the operations regardless of value.

However, those who use foreign exchanges or brokerages, or make peer-to-peer transactions in crypto, will have to report on the transactions if the monthly amount exceeded 30,000 Brazilian reais ($7,800), Cointelegraph Brazil reports.

## Penalties range from 1.5% to 3% of the amount of unreported transaction

Those who fail to report on their crypto transactions will face penalties ranging from 100 to 500 Brazil reais or from $25 to $130.

The IRS is also authorized to charge from 1.5% to 3% of the amount of the unreported transaction as a penalty, according to Agência Brasil.
