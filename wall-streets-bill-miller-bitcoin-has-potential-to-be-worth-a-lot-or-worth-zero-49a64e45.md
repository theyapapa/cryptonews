Bitcoin (BTC) can potentially have a high value or be worth nothing, noted Wall Street investor Bill Miller told CNBC in an interview on Monday, Jan. 7.

Miller, the founder of investment management firm Miller Value Partners, spoke to CNBC host Kelly Evans during a show called “The Exchange,” calling Bitcoin an interesting technological experiment and recalling a clear pattern of higher lows each year.

Miller told Evans:

“Bitcoin has the potential to be worth a lot and to be worth zero.”

"I'm a Bitcoin observer, but I wouldn't call it a believer," Miller concluded.

In December 2017, when Bitcoin hit its record mark of $20,000, Miller claimed to have invested almost 50 percent of the money from his hedge fund in top crypto.

Six months after, Miller said in an interview that he had been holding a modest one percent of his own assets in Bitcoin since 2014.

Moreover, Miller stated that “bubbles are necessary to bring capital into the market to see if these innovations are actually going to stand,” referring to Bitcoin’s rate in March 2018, when the coin was steadily going down after its historical peak.
