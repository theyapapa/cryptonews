Simetri Research, a crypto research and analysis service backed by digital currency reviewer Crypto Briefing and crypto price aggregator CoinMarketCap, has launched a new platform that displays short-term trading signals.

## Closing the information gap

Crypto Briefing announced the new service, Coins on the Move, on Aug. 22.

Simetri Research CEO Han Kao remarked that Simetri is an attempt to close an information gap that is detrimental to retail investors.

Our goal is to help redress that imbalance with SIMETRI — giving our best interpretation of multiple data points, to help investors understand the market as quickly and easily as possible.”

## Technical and fundamental analyses are insufficient

Kao further remarked that neither technical analysis nor fundamental analysis are good predictors of crypto price.

Crypto pricing is dictated by a unique hybrid of factors, such as the overall project strength, market trends such as staking, token momentum, investor sentiment, and of course the 24/7 news cycle.”

## Coinbase moves into trading signals

As reported by Cointelegraph, major crypto platform Coinbase announced in July that it would offer crypto trading signals to its customers.
