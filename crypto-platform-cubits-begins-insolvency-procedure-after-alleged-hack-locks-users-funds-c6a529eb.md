# Crypto Platform Cubits Begins Insolvency Procedure After Alleged Hack, Locks Users’ Funds ...

###### 2018-12-12 05:12

United Kingdom-based cryptocurrency payment platform Cubits has filed for administration following a sudden outage that locked customer funds, a company press release revealed Dec. 11.

Cubits, the trading name of legal entity Dooga Ltd., claimed it had lost funds worth €29 million ($32.8 million) to “fraudsters” in February 2018 that it was unable to reclaim.

Now, Dooga has brought in administrators “to work with those who are owed money by the Company and to collect monies that are owed.”

“Our goal is to achieve the best outcome for creditors generally at the earliest possible date,” one of the two newly appointed administrators Steve Parker commented in the press release, continuing:

“Dooga’s current position is secure, investigations are proceeding and we will be writing to creditors, formally, this week.”

Opus Business, now in charge of Cubits’ administration, has not responded to a request for comment on users’ locked funds by press time.

The company allegedly never paid Dooga the fiat due, leaving the company with debts totalling €35 million ($39.7 million).

“Since February, Dooga has made every possible effort to recover these funds,” the release continued:

“Unfortunately — contrary to expectations — these efforts have been unsuccessful up until now.”
