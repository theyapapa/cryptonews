With the increasing trend for major financial institutions to invest in Bitcoin, United States crypto exchange and wallet provider Coinbase announced the launch of over-the-counter (OTC) trading for institutional customers on Nov. 27.

Coinbase’s latest trading initiative began on June 6, when President and COO Asiff Hirji explained that obtaining a regulatory license would enable the company to set off on a “path to offer future services that include crypto securities trading, margin and over-the-counter (OTC) trading, and new market data products.”

Other financial players around the world are also looking for innovation opportunities.

On Nov. 30, 2018, Sberbank, Russia’s state-owned banking and financial services company, and Interros, a Moscow-based conglomerate, processed an OTC foreign exchange repurchase agreement transaction using smart contracts via blockchain, Reuters reports.

The VanEck’s Director of Digital Asset Strategies, Gabor Gurbacs, expressed his belief that their new OTC index would benefit the ongoing trend in the crypto market:

“The index may pave the way for institutionally oriented products, such as ETFs \[exchange-traded funds\] as well as provide further tools to institutional investors to execute institutional\[-\]size trades at transparent prices on the OTC markets.”

## Institutional trend continues to grow

On Oct. 31, Morgan Stanley, a multinational investment bank and financial services company, released their most recent report on Bitcoin, entitled “Update: Bitcoin, Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain.”

Bloomberg reported how institutional investors replaced high-networth players as the biggest buyers of cryptocurrency transactions over $100,000 and how the possibility to conduct OTC trades has drawn in hedge funds, injecting huge amounts of capital into the market.
