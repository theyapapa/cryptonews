# Top Crypto Exchange Binance’s CFO: Business Still Profitable, Despite Bear Market ...

The chief financial officer (CFO) of crypto exchange Binance — currently the world’s largest by daily trading volumes — has said business remains profitable, despite the market downturn.

With Bitcoin (BTC) trailing below $4,000 for the past ten weeks — and trading around 82 percent lower than its all time price high of $20,000 to press time — Zhou implied that the exchange’s profitability is not wholly dependent on the wider market picture.

AS CNBC reports, Zhou joined Binance in September 2018, having previously worked as CFO for Chinese jobs site Zhaopin and TV advertising firm Charm Communications, both of which reportedly went public under his stewardship.

Asked whether Binance could avail itself of Zhou’s experience to seek its own initial public offering, the CFO said there were no such plans in the short term.

Notably, Binance does not publicly disclose its financial figures, yet several hints have been given that suggest business is thriving, prior to Zhou’s statement.

Last November, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao — better known in the industry as CZ — said the company was not concerned by the bear market-induced drop in trade volumes, noting that volumes remain far above those of “two or three years ago.”

Last summer, CZ disclosed that Binance’s revenue for the first half of 2018 had been roughly $300 million — again, notwithstanding bearish market valuations.
