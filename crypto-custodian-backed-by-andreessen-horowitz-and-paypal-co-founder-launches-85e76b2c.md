The Anchorage cryptocurrency custodian for institutional investors launched following a $17 million funding round led by venture fund Andreessen Horowitz, a press release states Wednesday, Jan. 23.

According to the announcement, PayPal co-founder Max Levchin’s SciFi VC, venture company Khosla Ventures, Mark McCombe of investment firm Blackrock, and others also took part in the series A funding round.

Anchorage believes that large scale investments in digital assets, such as those from institutional players, will bring new growth to the blockchain space.

Andreessen Horowitz also took part in the Series E equity financing round of U.S. crypto exchange and wallet provider Coinbase, which plans to use the $300 million raised to “accelerate” the adoption of cryptocurrencies.

Some experts in fintech and the crypto sphere have predicted increased interest in the crypto space from institutional investors this year.

Conversely, unnamed sources told Bloomberg earlier this month that Wall Street’s crypto plans are largely on hold, as cryptocurrency values have continued to fall into the new year.

According to sources familiar with Goldman Sachs’ crypto business, the firm’s crypto activities have been too slow to be noticeable, and the company’s crypto non-derivative funds have attracted only 20 clients so far.
