KPMG suggests that an increasing number of companies will investigate blockchain technology this year.

“Blockchain projects will not succeed or scale without a multifaceted team that goes beyond technologists,” the firm states, thus identifying the four major skills needed for a career in the industry.

KPMG argues that the successful deployment of blockchain tech depends on professionals with both technology literacy and business acumen.

KPMG suggests that professionals in the field should have data analytics skills in order to understand and apply data derived from a blockchain, in addition to a “hacker mentality,” which requires teams to be open and able to explore and experiment by “hacking the problem” from multiple perspectives.

Earlier this year, KPMG released a survey showing that 48% of C-level executives believe blockchain is likely to change the way they do business in the next three years.

When asked about the possibility of implementing blockchain in their companies, 41% of respondents said they are likely to use the technology.

As for advantages and disadvantages of the decentralized technology, 23% of respondents believe that blockchain helps improve business efficiency.
