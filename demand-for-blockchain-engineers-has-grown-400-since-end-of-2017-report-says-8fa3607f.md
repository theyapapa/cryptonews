The average earnings of a blockchain engineer have soared to between $150-175,000 per year, CNBC reported Oct. 21, citing Hired’s 2018 State of Salaries Report.

Far higher than the $135,000 average software engineer salary, the figure puts blockchain engineers in the same pay bracket as artificial intelligence (AI) specialists, as the pace of blockchain recruitment demand gathers pace.

The figure is also notably higher than other specialized tech engineering roles; Hired CEO Mehul Patel told CNBC that:

"There's a ton of demand for blockchain.

Hired, which has reportedly provided data for blockchain roles as of 2017, says demand since then has soared 400 percent, despite the wider cryptocurrency bear market.

Hired told CNBC that while many job listings are defined under more generic roles such as “back-end engineer,” “systems engineer” or “solutions architect,” these often specify blockchain as a “desirable” skill for applicants.

Coveted knowledge encompasses “networking, database design and cryptography computing skills,” and fluency in the Java, JavaScript, C++, Go, Solidity and Python coding languages, CNBC notes, citing “multiple blockchain engineers” as its source.

Hired’s separate salary comparison tool further reveals that demand for blockchain engineer is highest in the San Francisco Bay Area, New York, and London.
