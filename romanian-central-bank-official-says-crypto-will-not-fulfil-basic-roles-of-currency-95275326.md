# Romanian Central Bank Official Says Crypto Will Not Fulfil Basic Roles of Currency ...

###### 2019-04-16 19:04

An official from the Romanian central bank has stated that cryptocurrency will not replace currency issued by central banks as it is not necessarily a currency.

Daianu also addressed the importance of making the distinction between blockchain technology and digital currencies.

\[...\] Cryptocurrencies will never be able to substitute the currency issued by a central bank.

What can happen is for central banks to have a digital currency, but that will also be issued by the bank, and commercial banks will receive digital currency that can multiply.

The draft reportedly described electronic money as “monetary value stored electronically, including magnetic, representing a claim on the issuer issued on receipt of funds for the purpose of performing payment transactions and which is accepted by a person other than the issuer of electronic money.”

A recent report from the World Economic Forum (WEF) revealed that at least 40 central banks globally are conducting research projects and pilots with blockchain technology that aim to address such issues as financial inclusion, payments efficiency and cybersecurity.

The WEF provided ten use cases for distributed ledger technology аt central banks including the development of retail central bank currency, among others.
