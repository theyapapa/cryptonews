# China: Bitcoin Mining Behemoth Bitmain Releases New 7nm Antminer Hardware ...

Bitcoin (BTC) mining giant Bitmain has officially released two new 7nm (nanometer) “Antminer” crypto mining machines, according to an official tweet posted Nov. 5.

Bitmain indicated in September that it would be equipping its new Antminer models with next-generation Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) chips.

ASIC chips are geared to compute optimally for a specific hashing algorithm and, as Bitmain’s tweet confirms, these latest “acceleration” chips use an SHA256 algorithm, which is based on 7nm Finfet semiconductor manufacturing technology.

Today’s tweet from the company reads:

“We are officially announcing the release of our new 7nm miners which possess industry-leading hash rates designed to mine with the SHA256 algorithm.

In Bitmain CEO and co-founder Jihan Wu’s keynote lecture in September, he outlined that the new chip integrates “more than a billion transistors,” using a special circuit structure and low power-intensive technology to optimize efficiency.

Bitmain has also made headlines this week by announcing it would be rolling out a firmware update for so-called ‘Overt AsicBoost’ to all its Antminer models, which it claims will increase mining “effectiveness” on the machines.

Crypto’s mining titans have been hot on each other’s heels to compete for the edge in advanced mining hardware; just a day ahead of Bitmain in September, Bitfury Group unveiled its own 14nm ASIC chip, dubbed Bitfury Clarke, which is customized for SHA256 Bitcoin mining.
