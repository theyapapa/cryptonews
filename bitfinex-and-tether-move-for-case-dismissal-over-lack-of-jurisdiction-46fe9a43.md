# Bitfinex and Tether Move for Case Dismissal Over Lack of Jurisdiction ...

Bitfinex and Tether lawyers are moving to dismiss their ongoing case versus the New York Attorney General (NYAG), according to court filings on May 21.

Law firms representing the two companies argue that the New York Supreme Court (NYSC) does not have jurisdiction over the alleged misconduct being considered.

The lawyers argue that the NYSC has neither personal nor subject matter jurisdiction and that the NYSC cannot be appealed to, because Bitfinex and Tether are neither operated out of New York nor harmed investors in that state.

As per the motion:

“The Office of the New York Attorney General (“OAG”) initiated this special proceeding

ostensibly ‘to protect New York investors.’

\[...\] But OAG chose to target two

virtual currency businesses that have nothing to do with New York investors — the businesses do not allow New Yorkers on their platforms and do not advertise or otherwise do business here.”

The case against Bitfinex and Tether was initiated via a court filing in April by NYAG Letitia James, who accused the two organizations of defrauding New York investors via a massive $850 million loss cover-up.

Regarding the impetus to file, James said:

“New York state has led the way in requiring virtual currency businesses to operate according to the law.
