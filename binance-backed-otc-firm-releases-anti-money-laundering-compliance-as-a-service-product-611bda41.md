Binance-backed over-the-counter (OTC) desk Koi Trading has partnered with IdentityMind, a platform for online risk management, to develop an Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance-as-a-service product.

The parties have reportedly released an AML compliance-as-a-service product dubbed “Koi Compliance,” supporting digital currency and targeting money services businesses.

The new platform will purportedly enable companies to focus on conducting their business, letting Koi Compliance to perform Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures, monitor transactions, conduct sanctions screening, and keep records.

Last November, Koi Trading received $3 million in investment from Binance Labs, an incubator arm of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchange (as of press time) Binance.

The move was purportedly taken to enable Binance Labs to utilize Koi’s quantitative research, data science, and compliance consulting services.

That same month, Binance confirmed to Cointelegraph that it would use an automated KYC application provided by financial software firm Refinitiv.

In January, Cointelegraph reported that blockchain compliance startup TRM, which developed a so-called token relationship management platform to help crypto businesses streamline their AML compliance, closed a funding round totalling $1.7 million led by United States-based investment firm Blockchain Capital.
