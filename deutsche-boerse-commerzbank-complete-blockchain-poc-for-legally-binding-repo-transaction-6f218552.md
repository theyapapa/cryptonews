# Deutsche Boerse, Commerzbank Complete Blockchain PoC for Legally Binding Repo Transaction ...

German financial services company Commerzbank and securities marketplace Deutsche Boerse have completed a proof-of-concept (PoC) for a legally binding repo transaction using distributed ledger technology (DLT).

A repo transaction is commonly used for short-term borrowing, and allows dealers to sell securities to investors — often for as short a time as overnight — and repurchase them the following day, or as otherwise determined.

As Cointelegraph Deutschland reports, to settle the transaction, Commerzbank and Deutsche Boerse generated digital tokens for both commercial bank money and securities.

While Commerzbank’s R&D unit “Main Incubator” developed the DLT platform, the full scope of the technology used for the DLT-powered repo transaction PoC — as well as its underlying legal concept — was reportedly developed jointly by the two partners.

Michael F. Spitz, CEO of Commerzbank’s R&D unit, has given a statement on the significance of the PoC, noting that:

"In past \[DLT\] pilots we have focused on new issue projects; with the transaction between Deutsche Boerse and Commerzbank we were now for the first time able to convert existing securities into digital tokens."

As the press release outlines, banks often use repo transactions as secured money market instruments in order to cover their “short-term liquidity needs by depositing securities.”

Last month, Commerbank conducted a pilot for money market security transaction using a Corda-based platform, in partnership with major technology firms Continental and Siemens.
