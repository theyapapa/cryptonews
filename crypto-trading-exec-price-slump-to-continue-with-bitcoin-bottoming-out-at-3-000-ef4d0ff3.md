# Crypto Trading Exec: Price Slump to Continue, With Bitcoin Bottoming Out at $3,000 ...

###### 2018-11-23 18:11

Michael Moro, the CEO of cryptocurrency trading companies Genesis Trading and Genesis Capital Trading, said that the Bitcoin (BTC) price could bottom at $3,000 in an interview with CNBC Nov. 23.

Moro addressed small resistance levels, saying that he does not think the BTC price can stabilize in “the mid-3s,” also noting that the $4,000 level was tested twice in the previous days.

The crypto trader said that long-term investors are more poised to handle BTC’s slump and wait until the price rebounds, while at the same time advising not to buy the cryptocurrency at the dip:

“This is about the fifth or sixth 75 percent-plus drawdown that we’ve seen in the 10-year history of Bitcoin.

And so if you have that \[long-term\] lens, I don’t believe institutional investors really ultimately care where the price of Bitcoin ends in 2018, simply because they’re looking at things three to five years out.”

When asked about what the low price of Bitcoin could mean for miners, Moro suggested that the cost to mine one Bitcoin will go down because “the hash rate has dropped.”

Bitcoin’s price has kept falling, along with the rest of the crypto market, since the hard fork network upgrade of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) that took place Nov. 15.

Earlier this week, Lou Kerner, a partner at venture capital firm CryptoOracle, compared the current slump in crypto prices to the dotcom burst in the early 2000s.
