# Coinbase Exec Joins Stablecoin Issuer TrueUSD as Head of Compliance ...

A former senior employee at United States crypto exchange Coinbase has left the industry giant to join stablecoin issuer TrustToken as head of compliance, according to the company’s official website Jan. 4.

Vaishali Mehta, whose LinkedIn profile indicates she served just over a year as senior compliance manager at the major San Francisco-based exchange, reportedly joined TrustToken in December 2018.

Mehta’s LinkedIn profile further details her background as head of BSA/AML (Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money laundering) risk and onboarding at Deutsche Bank’s offices in New York over a period of four years, as well as compliance roles at Japan’s Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank and India’s ICICI Bank, also in New York.

While Mehta’s move is testimony to the increasing prominence of stablecoin projects in the cryptocurrency space, other Coinbase veterans have taken steps that equally take the measure of wide-ranging changes in the sector.

In October, Adam White — Coinbase’s fifth-ever employee — left the exchange for a new role at Intercontinental Exchange’s (ICE) forthcoming digital assets platform Bakkt.

This November, Mike Lempres — former head of policy at Coinbase — also left the exchange to work at pro-crypto investment giant Andreessen Horowitz.

As reported, alongside Binance, other major crypto exchanges such as Huobi, Coinbase and OKEx have swiftly moved to list multiple fiat-collateralized stablecoins — USD Coin (USDC), Paxos (PAX), Gemini dollar (GUSD), as well as TUSD — on their platforms.
