# Important Aspects of Stablecoins: The Difference Between Pegging, Collateralization, and Redeemability ...

With cryptocurrencies today, we see the idea of stablecoins, such as USDVault, TrueUSD, Tether, Circle, Gemini, and Paxos Standard pegging 1:1 to a steady fiat currency like the US Dollar.

The same goes for commodity-backed assets, for every token a gold backed stablecoin platform issues, they should hold an equal value of physical gold as collateral, but, again, this does not always happen.

### Difference between backing and collateral

When a currency is backed by another commodity or asset, it does not necessarily mean the holder of the currency has that surety to exchange it, or have a claim on, the backed commodity.

Itâ€™s the same principle with gold-backed currencies, where physical gold might be held in reserves to back the currency and to stabilize it, but holders of the currency do not necessarily have a claim on the physical gold, only that they can redeem their currency at a fixed exchange rate against the gold.

That means in the case of collateralized cryptocurrencies, the holder of such a coin has an actual claim on the collateral, i.e. they can exchange it directly for its value in gold, USD, or even other cryptocurrencies.

On the other hand, a gold-backed stablecoin such as USDVault, is fully collateralized, meaning physical gold reserves to back issued tokens are held in vaults, which are transparently audited to make sure the stated value of gold actually exists, and a hedge mechanism is in place to maintain 1:1 USD price stability.

The important thing to determine is that, whether we are talking about the backing of a stablecoin or securing a loan, is the underlying asset adequate and reliable enough to achieve its purpose, i.e. to act as a security or to maintain stability?
