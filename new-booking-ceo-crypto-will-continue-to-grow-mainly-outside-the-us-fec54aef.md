CEO of online travel giant Booking Holdings believes that blockchain-based currencies will continue to grow and gain more popularity.

Glenn Fogel, recently appointed CEO of Booking, expressed his support of cryptocurrencies in an interview with New York-based travel publication Skift on Aug. 20.

## Potential for a new global currency

When asked about the future of payment systems in travel, the Booking CEO emphasized that it needs to be seamless, adding that data security must be prioritized.

Predicting that cash will become rare in the future, Fogel stated that he sees the potential for a new form of global currency that is protected and secure.

He stressed that such a currency would be especially popular outside the United States due to the widely-accepted credit card payment system.

He said:

“When Bitcoin became well known, many questioned its legitimacy, and while the jury is still out on the future of Bitcoin, I do believe currencies with a blockchain base will continue to surface and may become more widely accepted across the globe, especially outside the U.S., which has a well-accepted credit card payment system.”

## Founding member of Libra

Fogel was appointed as new CEO of Booking weeks after the travel giant was revealed to be a founding member of Facebook’s cryptocurrency Libra along with payment giants Visa and Mastercard in mid-June.
