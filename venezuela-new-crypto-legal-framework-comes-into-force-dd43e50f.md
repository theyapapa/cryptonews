The decree also establishes obligatory licenses for mining entities and crypto exchanges, and introduces fines for unlicensed activities.

The bill empowers the Sunacrip — a national crypto watchdog established in 2018 — to inspect the entirety crypto-related commercial activities in the country.

Moreover, the same article states that Sunacrip will be able to control “creation, emission, transfer, commercialization and exchange” of all crypto actives within Venezuela.

The Spanish-language crypto outlet Criptonoticias reported that this part of the document gives Sunacrip the ability to control any crypto commercial platform in the country, be it local or international, centralized or decentralized.

Furthermore, the decree describes the registration procedures for crypto exchanges, wallets, and mining entities.

In case any crypto-related company violates the licensing rules or fails to properly register with Sunacrip, its owners can be punished with up to one to three years in prison, and fined 50 to 100 sovereign crypto assets ($3,000 to $6,000).

However, its characteristics match with the description of the sovereign crypto asset, as it was issued in Venezuela and approved by government.
