The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) assistant governor Michelle Bullock said that the bank has not been convinced of the need to create a digital Australian dollar, local business and finance news outlet The Australian Financial Review reported Oct. 24.

Among “touted” benefits digital currency could provide to central banks, Bullock cited the possibility to technically leapfrog the monetary policy problem of the “lower bound,” by allowing a central bank to support negative interest rates.

Bullock said that before the bank could reasonably adopt a new asset like a digital currency, there would need to be a proven use case fore it.

Regarding the efficiency gain associated with the issuance of national currencies onto a distributed ledger, Bullock said that it is “not material” with respect to the other costs in the system.

The assistant governor stated that digital currency “certainly would be a simplification,” although:

"It isn't a requirement in the sense the inefficiencies we are seeking to resolve here do not reside in that last final exchange of cash in an existing digitized cash system with corresponding securities — that is actually a highly efficient and high-speed exchange."

In June, the central bank of Australia denied it would issue its own cryptocurrencies, calling Bitcoin (BTC) “fascinating” but “inefficient.”

Also in June, Board director of the Swiss National Bank (SNB) Thomas Moser said that cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology are too primitive to consider issuing a state-backed digital currency.
