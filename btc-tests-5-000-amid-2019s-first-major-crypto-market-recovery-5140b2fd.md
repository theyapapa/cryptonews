BTC, which skyrocketed yesterday and gained over 14 percent in price over 24 hours, spent a few hours above the $5,000 mark earlier today.

Bitcoin’s market cap has gained over $1 billion compared to yesterday’s charts, when BTC was mostly trading around $4,700.

Ethereum (ETH), currently the world’s second-top cryptocurrency by market cap, enters April 3 in the green, with up to 10 percent gains in 24 hours.

ETH’s market cap gained almost $2 billion in a day, climbing up to $17.6 billion at press time.

However, Lam cites an April Fool’s Day story that claimed that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had finally approved a Bitcoin ETF as possibly affecting the crypto markets, and CNBC shares his stance.

According to the financial experts quoted by the news agency, the gain was probably triggered by a 20,000 BTC order (around $100 million as of press time) that was spread around U.S.-based crypto exchanges Coinbase and Kraken and Luxembourg’s Bitstamp.
