Jihan Wu and the Jenke Group will be reportedly soon retire as CEOs of leading mining ASIC producer Bitmain.

In mid-November, Chinese local media reported that Wu would no longer be able to influence corporate decisions at the mining manufacturer, alleging that he had been demoted from the position of director to that of supervisor.

Odaily also reported today that unspecified sources declared that Bitmain is planning to cease all mining operations and already commissioned the relevant dealers to sell the used Antminer S9s.

At the time, Wu predicted that AI chips could account for around 40 percent of Bitmainâ€™s revenue in the next five years.

At the end of December, Chinese social media sources reported that Bitmain had already allegedly fired its entire staff of BCH developers.

As Cointelegraph reported today, Nvidia is facing a class action lawsuit over the losses reported by the company when lower crypto prices diminished demand for GPUs by miners.

As Cointelegraph also recently reported, after the decrease in GPU demand by miners, Nvidia was the worst performer in S&P 500, losing 54 percent of its stock price.
