Blockchain development company Blockstream has released a new version of its Bitcoin (BTC) scalability software, c-lightning, a post on the company’s blog reveals on March 1.

C-lightning is an implementation of the off-chain Bitcoin scalability solution, the Lightning Network (LN), that is written in the C programming language.

The main new feature is plugin supports, which allow developers to extend the capabilities of the software with plugins written in any programming language.

Last week, Blockstream co-founder and CEO Adam Back participated in the LN-based Lightning Torch Bitcoin relay.

As Cointelegraph reported in January, blockchain technology firm Bitfury Group has released a series of new tools for merchants and developers in a bid to drive wider adoption of the LN.

Data provided by a BTC statistics website revealed that the capacity of the Bitcoin Lightning Network has surpassed $2 million in December of last year.

Also in December, an R&D lab at crypto startup TenX tested the use of its cross-blockchain interoperability protocol to exchange Ethereum’s (ETH) ERC20 protocol tokens for Bitcoin using the Lightning Network.
