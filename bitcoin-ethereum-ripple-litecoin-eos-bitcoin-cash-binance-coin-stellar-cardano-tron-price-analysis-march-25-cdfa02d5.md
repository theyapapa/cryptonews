# Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, EOS, Bitcoin Cash, Binance Coin, Stellar, Cardano, Tron: Price Analysis, March 25 ...

###### 2019-03-25 14:03

Contrary to our expectation, if the XRP/USD pair rebounds from the current levels or from one of the supports on the downside, it will again try to rise above the overhead resistance of $0.33108.

A breakdown of the 20-day EMA and the uptrend line of the developing wedge will increase the probability of a fall to the 50-day SMA.

However, if the LTC/USD pair rebounds from the 20-day EMA, it will again try to breakout of the resistance line and rally to its next target objective of $69.2790.

With the 20-day EMA flattening out and the RSI close to 50, EOS is likely to become range bound for a few days.

Our bullish view will be invalidated if the digital currency turns down from the current level and plunges below the 20-day EMA.

If the price sustains below the 20-day EMA, the XLM/USD pair can plunge to the 50-day SMA.

On the other hand, if the digital currency turns down from the current levels and breaks below both the 20-day EMA and $0.051468, it will turn negative.
