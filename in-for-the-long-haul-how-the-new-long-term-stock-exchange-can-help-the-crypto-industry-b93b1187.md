# In for the Long Haul — How the New Long-Term Stock Exchange Can Help the Crypto Industry ...

###### 2019-05-18 10:05

Long-Term Stock Exchange (LTSE), which recently got approval from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a new stock exchange, could soon make it possible for companies to also raise funds through traditional means.

LTSE, building on an already mature stock market, could become a viable alternative for both for blockchain-related and nonblockchain companies that may have been looking to leverage the security token market to raise funds from patient investors.

Early stage Coinbase investor Garry Tan alluded to this issue in a tweet:

Companies do go public later and that is a problem since only private investors have access to the 10X to 100X appreciation in sub-$B valuation high growth

— Garry() (@garrytan) March 19, 2019LTSE aims to bridge this gap by encouraging early stage companies with long-term growth potential go public early.

The new stock exchange believes that companies delay IPOs mainly because of the market’s short-term thinking, which compels companies to focus on delivering stellar financial results from quarter to quarter.

To potentially force market participants to adopt a longer-term view, LTSE is building a structure that would encourage growing companies to attract and reward long-term, patient capital in the public market.

While foreign companies are able to list on the U.S. exchange, smaller companies that turn to the crypto market for funds may be overwhelmed by the listing requirements.

In such, the STO market, with its global reach, could still remain the best opportunity the small, non-U.S. companies have to gain access to long-term growth capital from public investors.
