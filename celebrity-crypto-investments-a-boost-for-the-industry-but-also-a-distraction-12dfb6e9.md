# Celebrity Crypto-Investments: A Boost for the Industry, but Also a Distraction ...

###### 2019-04-29 00:04

However, as validating as it may be to hear of another celebrity staking their own money on the success of crypto, celebrity investments won't be enough on their own to drive widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies, since they still remain a relatively rare occurrence.

Arguably the most active celebrity investor in such companies is Ashton Kutcher, the actor and one-time Calvin Klein model who launched his own venture capital firm — A-Grade Investments — in 2010.

Kutcher may be the most committed and outspoken celebrity investor in cryptocurrencies and crypto-related businesses, but he isn't the only famous individual to be all-in when it comes to crypto.

What's more, as CryptoOracle CEO Lou Kerner told Cointelegraph, their reputations really help to drive wider interest in crypto, particularly if the investors concerned are genuinely enthusiastic about cryptocurrencies:

"Investment from a celebrity like Serena Williams often generates press, which has value, but it's pretty ephemeral.

Artem Popov, the co-founder of blockchain-based investment service Roobee, also affirms that celebrity investments can boost public interest, so long as these investments come from individuals who are personally invested in the cryptocurrency space:

"Celebrity investments certainly bring hype and make the startup in question more appealing in the eyes of the general public and retail investors.

## Celebrity crypto ownership

As Lou Kerner adds, such celebrities as Ashton Kutcher and Nas are "the exception rather than the rule," since most of the celebrities who do associate themselves with crypto do so more in terms of superficial marketing endorsements.

But even if the number of celebrities who have actually invested in crypto projects can probably be counted on a few hands, there are also a number of celebrities who, rather than getting involved specifically in venture capitalism, have sought to invest in bitcoin, ether or some other cryptocurrency for their own personal advantage.
