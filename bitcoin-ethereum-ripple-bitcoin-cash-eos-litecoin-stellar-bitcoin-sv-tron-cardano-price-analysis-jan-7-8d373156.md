# Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, EOS, Litecoin, Stellar, Bitcoin SV, TRON, Cardano: Price Analysis, Jan. 7 ...

###### 2019-01-07 18:01

One of the important events to watch out for is the launch of International Exchangeâ€™s (ICE) crypto trading platform Bakkt.

While the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) currently offer Bitcoin futures trading, both of their products are settled in cash.

## BTC/USD

The tight range in Bitcoin was resolved to the upside on Jan. 6.

A break out of this level will complete an inverse head and shoulders pattern that has a target of $5,500.

On the upside, the upper bound of the descending channel might offer resistance; hence, traders should raise their stops to breakeven if the pair struggles at this level.

## EOS/USD

The level of $3 has been acting as a stiff resistance for the past few days.

The rising 20-day EMA and the bullish crossover suggest that the bulls have the upper hand in the near term.
