However, if bulls push the price above the 50-day SMA, a rally to the downtrend line is possible.

Conversely, if the price again turns down from the 20-day EMA, bears will attempt to resume the downmove and sink the cryptocurrency to the next support at $150.

## XRP/USD

The bulls have managed to keep XRP above the critical support of $0.24508 for the past five days, which is a positive sign.

On the other hand, if bulls fail to propel the price above the 20-day EMA, the XRP/USD pair might again retest the $0.225â€“$0.24508 support zone.

If the price does not scale above the 50-day SMA within the next few days, we anticipate another attempt by bears to sink the price below the neckline.

Conversely, if the bulls propel the price above the 20-day EMA, it will be a positive sign because the EOS/USD pair has not sustained above the 20-day EMA since Jun. 26.

The first sign of a likely change in trend will be a breakout and close (UTC time) above the 20-day EMA because this level has held fort since June 25.
