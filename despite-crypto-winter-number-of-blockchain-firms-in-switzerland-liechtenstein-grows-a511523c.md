The number of blockchain-related firms in Switzerland and Liechtenstein has continued to rise according to a survey conducted by Switzerland-based crypto investment firm CV VC, Cointelegraph auf Deutsch reports on Jan. 24.

Per the report, crypto- and blockchain-related firms continue to crop up in the region despite the current bear market, which some have dubbed the “crypto winter.”

CV VC states that at the end of December 2018, 750 companies using distributed ledger technology were located in Switzerland and Lichtenstein.

While noting an increased number of companies in the region, the report states that the recent decline in cryptocurrency prices has cut the market value of the 50 largest blockchain companies in Switzerland and Liechtenstein from $44 billion to $20 billion in Q4 2018, a decrease of 55 percent.

The governments of Switzerland and Liechtenstein have been active in supporting the nascent blockchain and crypto industries.

In early 2018, the Liechtensteinian Prime Minister Adrian Hasler announced the introduction of new legislation to regulate blockchain business models and underlying blockchain systems.

While the Swiss Minister of Finance rejected the idea of blockchain-specific legislation in December 2018, he believes that existing laws can be tweaked in order to provide sufficient legal certainty for companies operating in the blockchain and crypto spheres.
