# Crypto Community Reaction to Facebook Libra US Congressional Hearings ...

When asked challenging questions about Facebook’s plans for its Libra digital currency, Marcus mostly assured the lawmakers that Facebook would not be moving ahead with Libra until all regulators were satisfied with the plan.

## The U.S. government doesn’t trust Facebook’s Libra

It’s understandable that the government is worried about an international tech conglomerate attempting to issue a fiat-backed digital currency that could theoretically see more use than government-issued fiat currencies.

It’s almost as if the U.S. government was trying to take notes from Facebook in the congressional hearing on Libra.

It’s still unclear whether Facebook was able to allay any of the government’s fears and the timeline for Facebook’s digital currency is still similarly hazy, given the pushback as well as official government reactions.

## There are better digital currencies already out there

Lawyer Jake Chervinsky articulately summed up the guarded enthusiasm that cryptocurrency believers felt while listening to Facebook talk about its centralized digital currency to the government in a tweet:

“In a way, we couldn't have asked for a better company to get Congress thinking about these issues.

The same way that large conglomerates like Facebook, Telegram, etc. all are inevitably seeking to enter the digital currency space, Bitcoin and decentralized cryptocurrencies are simply trudging along without the ability for anyone to definitively speak to its future in front of Congress the way that Marcus did.

Jenny Shaver, the chief operating officer at SALT, a Colorado-based crypto firm that offers USD, stablecoin and crypto loans, told Cointelegraph that the Libra hearings could help bring awareness to the cryptocurrency industry:

“The industry has been lacking a consistent set of rules to abide by, and for the long-term development of the industry, we need to shape that structure with regulators.
