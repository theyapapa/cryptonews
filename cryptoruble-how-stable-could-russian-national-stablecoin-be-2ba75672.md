# CryptoRuble: How Stable Could Russian National Stablecoin Be? ...

On November 7, the chairman of Russia’s State Duma Committee on Financial Markets announced details of the “CryptoRuble,” a long-discussed government cryptocurrency project.

## Long and complex history of national cryptocurrency in Russia

Russian national cryptocurrency was originally referred to as “Bitruble,” but then the term “CryptoRuble” became more common in the media.

The history of CryptoRuble could be traced back to the fall of 2015, when a Moscow-based online payment settlement system, WebMoney, and Cyprus-headquartered payment service provider, Qiwi, separately approached the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) and offered to issue a state-controlled digital currency in the country.

Thus, in May 2016, Russian newspaper Kommersant reported that local officials were discussing the concept of a national cryptocurrency that would “minimize the amount of anonymous transactions,” citing the Assistant Director at Russia’s Federal Financial Monitoring Service (Rosfinmonitoring), Pavel Livadniy.

A few weeks later in the same month, the Russian Association of Cryptocurrency and Blockchain (RACIB) announced that the CryptoRuble will be launched in the middle of 2019.

On Nov. 2, 2018, the chairman of Russia’s State Duma Committee on Financial Markets, Anatoly Aksakov, said that his agency is considering the launch of state-backed cryptocurrency pegged to the Russian ruble.

Specifically, he said that the “cryptoruble,” which may appear after the adoption of laws regulating the cryptocurrency industry in Russia (which are also consistently changed and delayed), would be “the same ruble, just in encrypted form.”
