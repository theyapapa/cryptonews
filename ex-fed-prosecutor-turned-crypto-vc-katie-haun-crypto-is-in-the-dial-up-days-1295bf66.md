Former U.S. federal prosecutor and current cryptocurrency VC executive Kathryn Haun recently took part in a debate on crypto with Nobel-prize winning economist Paul Krugman, posted on YouTube by crypto venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) Nov. 2.

Krugman, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008, held his previous negative position on the topic, debating with Haun as a crypto skeptic.

In her preliminary speech that preceded the debate, Haun, who is also a board member at major crypto exchange and wallet service Coinbase, compared the current stage of cryptocurrency evolution to the early years of Internet:

"We're in the dial-up days \[of crypto\], and the critics out there confuse the current state of innovation with the end state of it."

However, Krugman opined, crypto hasn’t shown such advantages so far:

“There is very little sign that BTC is becoming any kind of widespread means of payment, and that’s ten years on, so when is it going to happen?”

Haun also reminded the audience that many people still tended to believe in myths about crypto and crime, which have slowed down mass adoption of the technology.

Haun spoke to the fact that crypto could exist without fully replacing fiat money:

“I don’t think cryptocurrencies will replace all of the other currencies, such as euro and dollar.

As Cointelegraph has previously reported, Haun was introduced to crypto and blockchain during her time in government when she worked as a prosecutor on the Silk Road case.
