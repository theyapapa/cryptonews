## Grayscale’s overall performance in Q2

Grayscale stated in the report that total investments into its single-asset and diversified investment products in Q2 2019 amounted to $84.8 million, which is nearly twice the amount the company saw in the previous quarter.

Of investors, institutional ones represented the highest percentage of total demand for Grayscale products, constituting 84%, since July 2018.

Alternative investment also registered a sharp increase, wherein alternative currencies accounted for 24% of inflows in Q2 against 1% in Q1.

70% of investments accounted for investors converting tokens they already held into shares of Grayscale products.

In general, Q2 ostensibly marked the first positive quarterly performance for all 10 of Grayscale’s investment vehicles.

As previously reported, Grayscale Investments’ Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) was up almost 300% on the year as of July 9.
