New York-based commercial bank Signature Bank will begin offering financial services to fintech firms in the island nation of Bermuda, local news daily the Royal Gazette reports on Feb. 28.

According to the Royal Gazette, banks in Bermuda have mostly avoided dealing with the fintech industry, which is in need of financial services.

Bermudian Premier David Burt said:

“Signature Bank’s willingness to consider Bermuda-licensed businesses for banking services is a significant vote of confidence in and endorsement of Bermuda’s efforts to create a leading high standard regulatory regime for fintech business.”

A reported government announcement stated that Signature Bank “has agreed to provide a full range of banking services to companies that meet Bermuda and Signature Bank standards.”

Signature Bank Vice-Chairman John Tamberlane said:

“We are impressed with the progress Bermuda has made to date on a regulatory front, and look forward to working with the Government of Bermuda to help promote growth and expansion of the fintech and digital asset industry in that country.”

In July 2018, the government amended the Banks and Deposit Companies Act 1999 to create a new class of bank for blockchain and fintech businesses.

Burt told the Royal Gazette today, “As a result of our business development and promotional efforts, 66 fintech companies have been incorporated in Bermuda.”
