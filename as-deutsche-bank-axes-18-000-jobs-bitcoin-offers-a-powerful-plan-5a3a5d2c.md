Deutsche Bank taking an axe to 18,000 jobs and winding down its investment banking arm paints a bleak picture of traditional finance at a time of booming growth for crypto.

As reported by Reuters on July 7, Deutsche Bank’s momentous decision will entail the bank exiting its equities sales and trading business — which had reportedly raked in €1.96 billion ($2.20 billion) in revenue in 2018.

In a tweet published July 7, Morgan Creek Digital Assets co-founder Anthony “Pomp” Pompliano interpreted the news as a robust endorsement for bitcoin (BTC) adoption, remarking:

“Deutsche Bank plans to fire almost 20,000 employees.

Many of these will purportedly be turned over to its newly-created “bad bank,” — a so-called Capital Release Unit, tasked with managing the wind-down of DB’s investment banking assets.

Notably, Jim Reid — head of global fundamental credit strategy at DB — had remarked that central banks’ dovish policies were positively impacting “alternative” currencies such as bitcoin while hurting investment banks.

Moreover, the fact that DB’s decision broke on a Sunday points to yet another Achilles Heel for traditional finance, according to VanECK digital asset strategist and MVIS director Gabor Gurbacs, who tweeted:

“Crypto markets are at least open 24/7 to act on news.

As one former equities broker today told BBC radio, the Deutsche Bank revelation is viewed by many as an inevitable and belated wake-up to the aftermath of the 2008 crash — the very cataclysm that Satoshi wryly alluded to within the bitcoin genesis block over a decade ago.
