South Korean technology behemoth LG applied for the “ThinQ Wallet” trademark with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) on July 2, data published on the official office’s website shows.

ThinQ is a brand first used for a smart refrigerator introduced by the company in 2011 at a consumer electronics show.

Since then, multiple smartphones have been launched under the ThinQ brand.

The trademark could signify that LG is aiming to compete with Samsung.

In May, Cointelegraph reported that the latter firm intends to roll-out cryptocurrency and blockchain features — including a wallet — into its budget smartphones.

As Cointelegraph reported earlier today, LG CNS, a subsidiary of LG Corp., will apply its proprietary blockchain platform to foster supply chain transparency for school cafeteria lunches.

In May, Taiwanese consumer electronics giant High Tech Computer (HTC) launched out in-wallet ERC20 token swaps for users of its Exodus 1 smartphone as a result of the company’s partnership with Ethereum (ETH)-based decentralized exchange Kyber Network.
