Blockchain software firm Digital Asset has partnered with Amazon Web Services (AWS) Aurora to make its open-source smart contract language Digital Asset Modeling Language (DAML) more interoperable.

The partnership will enable multi-platform DAML support for various blockchain networks, notably including Hyperledger Fabric and blockchain consortium R3’s Corda, both specifically cited in the press release.

Digital Asset’s cooperation with AWS Aurora — Amazon’s cloud storage engine — will enable firms to build applications using DAML and later add them to various blockchain networks.

The integration — to be available as of July — is reportedly enabled by Blockchain Technology Partners’ (BTP) management platform Sextant, available on the AWS Marketplace.

After open-sourcing DAML this April, Digital Asset soon announced it was integrating the language with Hyperledger Sawtooth, a modular platform for distributed ledgers, likewise enabled via a collaboration with BTP.

The press release notes that integration with Fabric was commercially enabled by HACERA’s Unbounded Network, which connects public and permissioned blockchains across clouds.

That same month, Digital Asset partnered with major cloud computing company VMware to integrate DAML with the latter’s blockchain platform.
