SP Group, a major corporation providing electricity and gas transmission in Singapore, has launched a blockchain-powered renewable energy certificate (REC) marketplace, the company reveals in a press release Monday, Oct. 29.

Samuel Tan, chief digital officer of the corporation, further explained:

“Through blockchain technology, we enable companies to trade in renewable energy certificates conveniently, seamlessly and securely, helping them achieve greener business operations and meet their sustainability targets.”

The marketplace will support both local and international RECs — the documents that serve as proof that a particular amount of electrical energy has been produced by solar batteries.

Three solar energy sellers — Cleantech Solar Asia, LYS Energy Solutions and Katoen Natie Singapore — are also joining the marketplace.

Singapore is not new to blockchain-powered energy solutions.

Decentralized platforms are widely used to back solar energy production and trading.

And in September, Australian real estate giant Vicinity announced it will trial a blockchain solutions within its $75 million solar energy program, testing it to supply a shopping mall with renewable energy.
