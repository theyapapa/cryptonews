# Binance CEO: Bitcoin Futures Platform ‘SAFU’ After Attack False Alarm ...

###### 2019-09-16 03:09

The CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Binance has dispelled fears a bad actor had attacked its newly-launched Bitcoin futures platform.

## Technical error crashed Bitcoin price

In a series of tweets on Sept. 16, Changpeng Zhao, also known as CZ, initially warned that the exchange’s futures were under attack from one of its own market makers.

Binance launched its futures platform in invite-only mode following a user testing period earlier this month.

## CZ: Only “attacker” lost money

In the event, the attack turned out to be a false alarm, originating from a technical error on the market marker side.

The entity remains unknown, Zhao only revealing it was also an operator of Bitcoin futures.

Due to Binance’s own settings, meanwhile, the $300 dip did not liquidate other traders’ positions; only the accidental attacker lost funds.

Binance forms one of two major Bitcoin futures offerings to hit the market this month.
