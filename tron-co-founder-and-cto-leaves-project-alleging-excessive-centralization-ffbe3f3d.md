# Tron Co-Founder and CTO Leaves Project, Alleging Excessive Centralization ...

Lucien Chen — the former chief technical officer (CTO) and co-founder of blockchain protocol Tron (TRX) — has announced he is leaving the project, claiming it has become excessively centralized and strayed from its founding principles.

In his announcement, Chen recounts the history of the Tron project and TRX’s successful growth to become the 11th largest cryptocurrency by market cap globally.

Foremost among his concerns, Chen argued that the project is no longer faithful to its founding principle of decentralizing the web — becoming ostensibly excessively centralized, as well as neglecting to foster internet-focused commercial applications in its ecosystem.

He critiqued Tron’s delegated proof-of-stake \[DPoS\] consensus mechanism and Super Representative governance and block production nodes, arguing that:

“The DPOS mechanism of Tron is pseudo-decentralized.

The top 27 SR nodes (block nodes) have more than 170 million TRX votes, and most of them are controlled by Tron.

In addition to his concerns over centralization, Chen also said that as the former CTO who helped build the platform, he knows that real internet applications currently can’t function in the Tron network.

Having left Tron, Chen is now launching his own decentralized blockchain project, dubbed “Volume Network.”
