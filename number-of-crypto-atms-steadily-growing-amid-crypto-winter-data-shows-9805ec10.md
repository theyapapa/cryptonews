The number of new crypto ATMs around the world continues to grow despite the recent crypto market collapse, according to data.

Coin ATM Radar’s information shows that in November, different ATM manufacturers opened 209 tellers around the world, and 68 of the previously installed ones closed.

In addition, three countries — Peru, Albania and South Korea — have had their first crypto ATM installations in November.

The first two received ATMs created by General Bytes, a major Bitcoin ATM manufacturer based in Prague, while South Korea received a teller from local manufacturer DOBI ATM.

General Bytes installed the largest amount of ATMs all over the world (80), followed by U.S. manufacturer Genesis Coin (36) and Lamassu Bitcoin Ventures (12).

Bitcoin (BTC) was accepted by the greatest number of ATMs, with 4,042 machines all over the world in total accepting the top crypto.

As Cointelegraph reported in November, the developers of India’s first Bitcoin ATM — also the co-founders of the Unocoin crypto exchange — were arrested in the city of Bangalore on criminal charges, reportedly including criminal conspiracy, cheating and forgery.
