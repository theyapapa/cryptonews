Thai citizen Prinya Jaravijit, who allegedly defrauded a Finnish investor of $24 Million worth of Bitcoin (BTC), has recently been detained in Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok, the Bangkok Post reports Friday, Oct. 12.

According to newspaper, Jaravijit arrived in Bangkok on a flight from South Korea en route from the U.S., where he allegedly spent two months after his brother’s detention in connection with the same crime.

Shortly after the arrest Jaravijit, who was wanted on charges of conspiracy to defraud and money laundering, was delivered to local police where he was questioned.

As per the Bangkok Post, in January Finnish investor Aarni Otava Saarimaa along with his Thai business partner Chonnikan Kaewkasee complained to the Thai Crime Suppression Division (CSD).

As Cointelegraph previously reported, the case came to public attention when soap-opera actor Jiratpisit "Boom" Jaravijit — Prinya’s younger brother — was detained in August.

In October, the Thai Money Laundering Office confiscated funds worth $6.4 million from Jaravijit's family and other people connected to the case, and is preparing to charge the suspects with fraud.

Following the detention of his brother, Prinya Jaravijit reportedly fled to the U.S. to avoid charges.
