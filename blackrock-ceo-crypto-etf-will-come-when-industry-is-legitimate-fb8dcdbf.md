# BlackRock CEO: Crypto ETF Will Come When Industry Is ‘Legitimate’ ...

The CEO of investment management corporation BlackRock, Larry Fink, does not see the company offering a cryptocurrency Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) until the industry is “legitimate,” CNBC reported Nov. 1.

Speaking at the New York Times Dealbook Conference in Manhattan on Nov. 1, Fink questioned the reasonability of launching a crypto ETF, at least until the industry becomes “legitimate.”

Fink reportedly said that ETFs “ultimately” have to be backed by a government, and that a government would not greenlight such a financial instrument unless it knew the funds were not being used for illicit activities.

Fink noted Bitcoin’s (BTC) anonymity as a risk factor, since the leading digital currency could possibly be used for “tax evasion and all of these other issues."

Although Fink expressed some skepticism towards cryptocurrencies, he pointed out that the company is “a huge believer in blockchain.”

Fink’s comments come ahead of the Nov. 5 deadline that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) set for reviewing proposed rule changes related to a series of applications to list and trade various BTC ETFs.

Last month, crypto analyst and host of CNBC’s show Cryptotrader Ran Neuner claimed that a Bitcoin ETF is a “way bigger deal” than a cash settlement Bitcoin futures contract, since it “requires actual purchase of BTC.”
