Digital asset trust and security company BitGo has appointed wallet provider Xapo’s former senior vice-president Pete Najarian as its new chief revenue officer (CRO).

As finance-focused media outlet Finance Magnates reported on Aug. 19, Najarian will now serve as BitGo’s CRO, reporting to the company’s chief executive officer Mike Belshe.

Commenting on the appointment, Belshe said:

“Pete has a deep understanding of capital markets and an exceptional breadth of experience in financial services.

We’re building the financial infrastructure of the future and Pete’s experience in both traditional financial markets and cryptocurrency will be critical.”

Najarian’s profile on business and employment network LinkedIn reveals that he previously served as global head of emerging markets sales at the Royal Bank of Scotland, and head of institutional client coverage-APAC at financial services firm UBS, among others.

BitGo is reportedly planning to grow its Japan-based team, including hiring a sales director for the company’s Tokyo office.

In May, BitGo appointed veteran Wall Street trader Nick Carmi as its head of financial services.
