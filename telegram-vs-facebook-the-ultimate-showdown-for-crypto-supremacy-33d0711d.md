# Telegram Vs. Facebook: The Ultimate Showdown for Crypto Supremacy ...

## If Libra is the Empire Strikes Back, Telegram is A New Hope

While Facebook has 1.8 billion users, Telegram raised $1.7 billion.

While Facebook has the unwashed masses who’ve never held a Bitcoin, Telegram has the entire crypto community that lives and breathes altcoins for breakfast.

If you’re a pioneering member of the crypto community, you might have looked with scorn on the Telegram fundraiser, which beat the initial coin offering regulatory backlash by raising all of its money from private accredited investors, rather than crowdsourcing it from the people.

Durov, on the other hand, refused to create a backdoor to Telegram when the Russian Supreme Court demanded it — and even as American companies like Apple, which normally stand tough on privacy, caved and yanked Telegram from the app store.

Even though Telegram defends its choice of architecture, as it gives people the best of both worlds with the choice of secret chats, the criticism continues to dog the company to this day.

While Facebook soaks up the punishment and pressure from hysterical governments and politicians who say with a straight face that they’re worried that Libra’s wallet — which is compliant with Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering laws — can be used for “terrorism," Telegram’s team wisely stays out of the spotlight, just like Satoshi Nakamoto did with Bitcoin.

While Libra can and will leverage Facebook’s 1.7 billion users to rapidly accelerate adoption, Telegram’s user base of over 200 million people is a growing force in its own right.
