Bitcoin’s (BTC) trading volume on Coinbase recently hit its highest level since Feb. 4 of last year, which shows that the price is rising higher backed by strong demand.

Consolidation near the highs is a positive sign: it is usually followed by a breakout and continuation of the upward move.

If the bulls push the price above the resistance line of the ascending channel, the pair will rally to $158.91.

The BSV/USD pair has formed an inside week candlestick pattern and is finding support close to a 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the recent rally, while it is facing resistance near the high of $254.

This points to a consolidation in the next few weeks, and a range formation after such a sharp move is a positive sign.

The exchange has also released its official Trust Wallet for the Binance DEX users, and also plans to issue its own stablecoin within the next two months, which will be 100% pegged to the British pound and will be called “Binance GBP.”

On the contrary, if the bulls struggle to propel the price above the resistance line, a few weeks of consolidation is possible.
