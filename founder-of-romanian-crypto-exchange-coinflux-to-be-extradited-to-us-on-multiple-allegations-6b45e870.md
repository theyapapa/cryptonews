Nistor Vlad Călin, the founder of Romanian crypto exchange Coinflux, will be extradited to the United States, local media company Mediafax reports Jan. 4.

As Cointelegraph reported in December, Călin was arrested earlier on a warrant from the U.S. for organized crime, money laundering and fraud allegedly conducted through his cryptocurrency exchange.

Călin has been reportedly arrested by the U.S. authorities after a note from a secret service agent accused him of knowingly helping to launder proceedings of criminal activity committed on the territory of the United States.

According to the most recent report by Mediafax, Anatol Pânzaru, Călin’s lawyer, has declared before the Bucharest Court of Appeal that the conditions of the treaty on judicial cooperation between Romania and the United States have not been met.

Furthermore, Pânzaru has claimed that his client had no way of knowing that the cryptocurrency in question was earned via fraudulent activity.

He also demanded from the court to reject the extradition request.

As Cointelegraph reported in December, the Supreme Court of Greece has approved the extradition of Alexander Vinnik, the purported former operator of the now-defunct crypto exchange BTC-e, to France, based on allegations of money laundering.
