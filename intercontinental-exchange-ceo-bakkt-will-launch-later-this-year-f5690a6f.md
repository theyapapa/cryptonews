# Intercontinental Exchange CEO: Bakkt Will Launch Later This Year ...

###### 2019-02-09 17:02

The CEO of the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) expects the firm’s digital asset platform Bakkt to launch later in 2019.

Sprecher explained that the company spent over $1 billion on strategic initiatives, including on the launch of the digital asset platform.

The company’s CFO, Scott Hill, further revealed his expectations on the expenses Bakkt is set to bring, based on its current financial performance:

“And finally, our investment in Bakkt will generate $20 million to $25 million of expense based upon the run rate in the first quarter.

When asked about the expected returns or revenue growth from recent investments, including Bakkt, Sprecher characterized the crypto platform as a “moonshot bet” for ICE:

“So it's a bit of a moonshot bet and it's been organized in a manner that is very different than the way ICE typically does businesses \[...\] They're well along in building out an infrastructure that I think you'll see launch later this year.”

Sprecher added that Bakkt exists independently from ICE, as it has its own offices, management team and infrastructure.

“I think Bakkt is really an investment \[...\] That's more about the future and revenue and market opportunities that we see in the future and less about 2019 topline,” Hill said.

ICE first announced the launch of its digital asset platform in August 2018.
