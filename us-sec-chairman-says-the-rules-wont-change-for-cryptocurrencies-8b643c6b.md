United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Jay Clayton says he won’t make exceptions in securities law for cryptocurrencies, but he won’t stand in their way either.

## SEC rule changes ‘ain’t happening’

Bloomberg published an interview with Jay Clayton on Aug. 27.

According to Clayton, he has no desire to change securities laws, either to include or exclude digital assets for regulation.

He further said:

“If we have a way to reduce the cost of payments internationally, through technology, I am all for it \[...\] But you can’t sacrifice basic principles of securities law, and other law, to allow it to happen.’’

However, he remarked that the SEC has determined many initial coin offerings (ICOs) to be fit for securities regulation.

## Recent legal action

The SEC has taken numerous companies to court over misdoings in the course of ICOs.

Also earlier in August, the SEC successfully requested a freeze on assets belonging to Reginald Middleton and his Veritaseum Inc. amid a case alleging that Veritaseum’s $15 million ICO was fraudulent.
