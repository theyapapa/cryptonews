Eos (EOS) parent company Block.one has announced a blockchain-based social media platform called Voice, according to a press release shared with Cointelegraph on June 1.

The firm claims that the platform will use the Eos blockchain to provide transparency on how it operates, without hidden algorithms or content-pushing mechanisms of which the user is unaware.

In the press release, the CEO of Block.one, Brendan Blumer, compared Voice with traditional social media platforms, saying:

“The truth is, current social media platforms are designed to use their users.

But right now, it’s the platform, not the user, that reaps the reward.”

As per the report, Block.one recently joined the Coinbase Earn program, an educational offering by major crypto platform Coinbase.

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Eos recently partnered with Tether to put Tether’s USD-pegged stablecoin USDT on the Eos blockchain.

According to a recent study by Diar, social media giant Facebook’s own payments-focused cryptocurrency, Globalcoin, will face demographic challenges, as the platform’s user base is aging.
