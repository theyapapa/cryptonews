# Zcash Foundation Says ZEC Developer Broke Trademark Promise ...

###### 2019-09-03 03:09

The Electric Coin Company (ECC), the developer of second-biggest anoncoin Zcash (ZEC), has reneged on its declared intent to share its trademark with the non-profit Zcash Foundation.

## “We already have an agreement in principle”

The Foundation notes that ECC has long-signalled its intent to share its trademark with the non-profit, which was created in March 2017 to help grow the altcoin’s community, educate the general public about the asset and “steward the Zcash protocol and source code as a public good.”

The blog post links to a presentation at the Zcon1 conference in Croatia in June 2019, at which ECC CEO Zooko Wilcox declared his commitment to a 2-of-2 controlling agreement with respect to the Zcash trademark.

As Wilcox outlined at the time, ECC (the company) and the Foundation were apparently working at the time:

“To make control over the Zcash trademark be shared between the Foundation and the company.

The CEO had further anticipated that this 2-of-2 agreement — which would require both the Foundation and the ECC to unanimously agree that a certain thing counts as the bonafide Zcash and can be officially labelled as such — would have “deep effects in the long-run, and good ones.”

## Refusal to engage in “decentralization theater”

Notably, early on in its history, the Foundation’s founders had conceded that while they had considered the option of asking ECC to donate its trademark and other assets:

“There’s a good argument that the Zcash Co has the most incentive right to invest in and maintain their own property.

The Foundation’s position has since evidently evolved and its members note with dismay that the timing of ECC’s decision is already harming the development of new initiatives, such as the ECC’s proposed dev fund and community sentiment collection efforts on the matter.
