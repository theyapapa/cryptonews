In his recent address, Maltaâ€™s Prime Minister Joseph Muscat has said that cryptocurrencies and blockchain can solve several problems and will become the money of the future.

A break out of the overhead resistance of $250 and the 50-day SMA will tilt the balance in favor of the bulls.

## BCH/USD

Though Bitcoin Cash has held the 50-day SMA for the past two days, the bulls have failed to secure a bounce.

As the price has been sustaining above the descending channel and the moving averages for the past four days, we suggest traders hold their long position with the stops at $400.

If the XLM/USD pair turns down from the current levels, it might break down of both moving averages and slide to the next support at $0.21489857.

Both moving averages are flat and the RSI is close to 50 levels, which shows a state of equilibrium between the bulls and the bears.

## DASH/USD

Dash has been trading between the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA for the past two days.
