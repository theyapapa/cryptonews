# Ripple CEO: Moneygram Using XRP a Bigger Deal Than Facebook’s Libra ...

###### 2019-08-09 05:08

Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse says the firm is looking into multiple investments and acquisitions following its $30 million partnership with MoneyGram this June.

Finance reported on Aug. 9, Ripple’s deal with MoneyGram — the second-largest remittances firm worldwide — saw it purchase a 10% stake in the entity, with an option to increase its investment by a further $20 million within two years.

## Moneygram starts using xRapid

MoneyGram began using Ripple’s xRapid liquidity product on Aug. 3 — a central stipulation of the $30 million deal — as revealed by Moneygram CEO Alex Holmes during the company’s second-quarter earnings call earlier this month.

Finance, Garlinghouse rebuffed the notion that Ripple had forked out a premium on Moneygram shares to ensure the firm would adopt the technology:

‘“I wouldn’t characterize it as an inducement \[...\] we’re getting more and more customers to sign up and we’re seeing that value.

Garlinghouse revealed that Ripple paid a high price for the deal given the reluctance of private equity firm Thomas H. Lee Partners to sell at market values: Moneygram shares had dropped almost 80% in the 12 months leading up to the partnership, but surged 168% thereafter.

## ‘This is a big deal’

The Moneygram partnership, Garlinghouse claimed, represents one of the first use cases of a crypto asset in production at scale:

“This is a big deal.

With xRapid volumes up 170% between Q1 and Q2 2019 — even ahead of the Moneygram development — the CEO forecast xRapid would hit over $1 billion in volume by 2020.
