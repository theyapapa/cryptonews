The Chicago Board Options Exchange’s (CBOE) BZX Equity Exchange has apparently withdrawn its request for a rule change by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

According to an official notice published on Jan. 23, BZX withdrew a proposed rule change that would allow it to list a Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF).

The proposal, which was first filed with the SEC back in June 2018, experienced several delays, as the U.S. financial watchdog postponed its decision on the rule change pursuant to Section 19 of the Securities Exchange Act.

As per an SEC filing, the price of each share of the VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust is set to $200,000.

Last week, crypto entrepreneur and regular CNBC contributor Brian Kelly said that there is “no shot” for Bitcoin ETF approval in 2019.

Kelly said that the SEC is unlikely to change from its sceptical position toward crypto ETFs, as “there is too much that is unresolved.”

According to the analyst, it will take more than a year to settle existing issues

SEC commissioner Hester Peirce — dubbed “Crypto Mom” for her dissent with the commission’s decision to reject a Bitcoin ETF proposed the Winklevoss twins — said that a Bitcoin ETF is “definitely possible,” but it could take a while:

“Definitely possible could be 20 years from now or it could be tomorrow.
