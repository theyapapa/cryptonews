The world’s second-largest stock exchange Nasdaq has revealed that seven crypto exchanges are already using its market monitoring technology, Forbes reported Jan. 30.

A Nasdaq representative told Forbes that the firm assesses prospective cryptocurrency clients according to three broad criteria — their business model, Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering measures and exchange governance and controls.

Around 20 Nasdaq employees are thus reportedly tasked with assessing whether the applicant crypto exchange has not only the technical capacity, but also the “moral inclination” to use the anti-market manipulation tool judiciously.

Tony Sio, from Nasdaq’s market surveillance division, told Forbes:

“Historically, we don’t do such a large vetting process for our clients because they are much more well-known.

Last November, Nasdaq revealed a partnership with United States investment firm VanEck to jointly launch a set of regulated and surveilled digital assets products, which are set to harness the SMARTS system.

Crypto exchanges have implemented other tech from Nasdaq in the past.

Just this week, Nasdaq joined Citigroup and Mike Novogratz’s crypto-focused merchant bank, Galaxy Digital Holdings in a $20 million investment in a blockchain and smart contract platform for capital markets.
