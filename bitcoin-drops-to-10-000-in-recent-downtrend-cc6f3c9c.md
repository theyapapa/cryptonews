Despite exceeding $12,000 several times this month, Bitcoin (BTC) has slumped back to $10,000 in a recent downtrend.

A little earlier this month, experts were optimistic about Bitcoin continuing its rally, citing geopolitical tensions — particularly the ongoing United States-China trade war — as a reason for its possibly continuing success.

Forbes contributor and former executive director at Deutsche Bank Peter Tchir recently wrote in an article that Bitcoin is a leading indicator of hidden geopolitical tensions.

Crypto investors are reportedly now divided into three main camps regarding Bitcoin price predictions.

The most bearish of the three say that Bitcoin is set to pull back to $8,500–$7,500 while the moderates say it will consolidate between $9,000 and $12,000 prior to its rewards halving in 2020.

The bulls remain unphased by recent price trends and remain confident that Bitcoin will retake its yearly high and continue upwards.

At press time, Bitcoin is trading at $10,048, down 5.81% on the day and almost 16% on the week according to data from Coin360.
