It’s hard to tell who was the first to coin — pun intended — Bitcoin (BTC) as “digital gold,” underlining the idea that Bitcoin is a good store of value.

For thousands of years of human history, people have used precious metals — namely copper, silver and gold — to fulfill the main functions of money: a unit of account, a medium of exchange and a store of value.

— Changpeng Zhao,

CEO of Binance

“Bitcoin might be the greatest store of value in the history of the world.

— Joseph Bonneau

Lecturer at New York University (course on crypto),

Co-author of “Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies”
