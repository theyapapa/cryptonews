Bloomberg’s analysts have joined the ranks of experts who consider that Bitcoin (BTC)’s low volatility levels recently signal the coin is finding a bottom, according to an analysis published Oct. 24.

Data analyzed by Bloomberg reveals that in October, BTC had only one day of price swings of (+/-) 5 percent or more; as compared with nine days in January and February, seven in March, and five in July.

Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Mike McGlone is quoted as saying that the markedly low volatility levels are “a sign of speculation leaving the market and eventually a bottoming process."

Notably, diminished price swings have coincided with a significant devaluation of the coin over the course of an unflagging bear market: as of press time, Bitcoin is trading at $6,476, down almost 52 percent from around $13,350 Jan. 1.

According to Bloomberg data, “the spread between the 10-day volatility of the NYSE FANG+ Index” and Bitcoin has hit “a record high of 46 percentage points.”

Bloomberg’s analysts gave a positive perspective on Bitcoin’s rangebound trading patterns, with McGlone noting that “high volatility is a major factor lessening most cryptocurrency use cases for anything other than speculation."

Earlier this month, Spencer Bogart, an expert from crypto and blockchain venture firm Blockchain Capital concurred that Bitcoin is showing strong signs of “bottoming,” anticipating a “future crypto bonfire when we have the next bull market."
