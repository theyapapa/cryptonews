# Crypto Industry in Numbers: How Does Q2 2019 Compare to the Past ...

According to Aditya Das, the in-house market analyst for blockchain and crypto asset market data company Brave New Coin, the shifts in the structure of crypto trading could also be responsible for both the general upward trend and bitcoin’s robust performance:

"The crypto trading ecosystem enjoyed an excellent Q2 2019 led by market benchmark, bitcoin.

BTC prices have more than doubled since the beginning of April, and over the quarter bitcoin’s dominance of the overall crypto asset market cap has grown from ~45% to ~62% — an 18-month high.

Dave Hodgson, the director and co-founder of Nem Ventures, the venture capital and investments arm of the Nem blockchain ecosystem, added that part of the reason for the growth of crypto markets lies in the weakness of the traditional financial markets:

“This is all happening against the backdrop of traditional equity, bond, and commodity markets which are generally becoming unattractive, and a financial system in which we are seeing negative interest rates.

For one, Das from Brave New Coin pointed to the success of several middleware protocols:

“Beyond Bitcoin, Chainlink, a blockchain platform that aims to connect smart contracts to external data sources, has become the first middleware protocol to achieve a billion-dollar valuation.

The recent announcement of Facebook’s Libra launch rivals JP Morgan’s announcement of JPM Coin from earlier this year in terms of industry impact — belying a renewed enthusiasm for blockchain adoption globally and consumer and corporate interest in the benefits that emerging technologies can accrue.”

Lilin Sun, co-founder of PlatON — a computing architecture for open data sharing — echoed Ou in bringing up Libra’s relationship with JPM Coin and its general impact on adoption and regulation:

“Q2 witnessed the launch of Facebook’s Libra heralding a new era for the blockchain and cryptocurrency space.

The growing awareness of digital assets and blockchain seems to be triggered not just by speculation and hype around surging prices: A huge part of it has to do with implementation of real-life solutions, Corentin Denoeud, CEO and co-founder of Blockchain Studio, a platform for the creation of decentralized applications, said:

“Following the monumental crash of 2018, we have witnessed a significant shift in the conversations surrounding blockchain and cryptocurrencies.
