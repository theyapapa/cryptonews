###### 2018-10-09 17:10

Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) services firm Bitcoin.com is planning to buy or set up its own crypto exchange, the companyâ€™s CEO Roger Ver revealed in an interview with Bloomberg Oct. 9.

According to Ver, the upcoming crypto trading platform will be placed on the Bitcoin.com website, which is expected to generate a great amount of traffic via various services such as wallet transactions and news.

The early Bitcoin investor and Bitcoin Cash proponent also revealed that the new crypto exchange would implement Bitcoin Cash as its base currency, which will purportedly boost the adoption of the digital coin.

The Bitcoin Cash evangelist has stated several times that BCH is more true to the original intent of Satoshi Nakamoto and a better currency than Bitcoin.

He tweeted Oct. 9:

\#BitcoinCash is the Bitcoin described by Satoshi Nakamoto: P2P Electronic Cash for the world.

In May 2018, Bitcoin.com was quietly removed by major crypto markets tracking website CoinMarketCap, following allegations that Bitcoin.com was misleading customers into buying Bitcoin Cash instead of Bitcoin.

Following a report on the significant decrease of BCH adoption in global payments, as well as some pessimistic forecasts on the BCH price, the Bitcoin Cash team conducted the so-called BCH stress test.
