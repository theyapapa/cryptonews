# Money 20/20: Experts Debate Whether Blockchain Will Replace Current Payment Systems ...

Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz and FIS Payments Senior Vice President of Product Strategy Esther Pigg offered competing visions of whether blockchain will benefit payments.

According to Schwartz, blockchain technology will replace the world’s current payment systems, the developers of which are “putting bandages on a system that dates back to the dial-up era.”

Blockchain will do to payment systems what email did to traditional post, Schwartz said.

In his view, blockchain based payment systems will allow for smaller and more frequent payments that do not exist in the current payments ecosystem, because it is too slow and expensive:

“If you look in your email right now I’m sure 99 percent of what you see would never have been a postal mail.

Schwartz further argued that blockchain is “the right technology” for a new payments system because it is secure and allows “every participant to verify personally every system rule.”

Pigg began her argument by posing the question “what problem does blockchain solve that cannot be solved with existing payment platforms equally as well.”

Pigg concluded by saying that blockchain has potential, and should be explored, but it is “not clearly understood nor vetted,” and will “absolutely not” replace today’s payment platforms.
