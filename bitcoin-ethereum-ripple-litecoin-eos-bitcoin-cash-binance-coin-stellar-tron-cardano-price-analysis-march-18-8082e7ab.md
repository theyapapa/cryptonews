# Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, EOS, Bitcoin Cash, Binance Coin, Stellar, Tron, Cardano: Price Analysis, March 18 ...

###### 2019-03-18 10:03

## LTC/USD

Litecoin (LTC) broke above the resistance line on March 16, but it is facing profit booking at higher levels.

If the LTC/USD pair breaks down of the 20-day EMA, it can slide to the next support at $47.2460.

## EOS/USD

EOS has been struggling to breakout of $3.8723, but is finding support close to the 20-day EMA.

But if the pair turns down from the current levels and breaks below the 20-day EMA, a fall to $3.1534 is probable.

Still, with the 20-day EMA starting to slope up and the RSI in the overbought zone, the path of least resistance is to the upside.

Our bullish view will be invalidated if the price turns down from the current levels and slips below the 20-day EMA.

## TRX/USD

Though Tron (TRX) broke out of the 20-day EMA on March 16, it turned back from the 50-day SMA.
