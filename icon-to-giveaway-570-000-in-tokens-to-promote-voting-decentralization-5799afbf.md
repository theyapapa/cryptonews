The Icon Foundation, the group behind the Icon blockchain network, is giving away 3 million ICX tokens — worth ~$570,000 — in anticipation of its upcoming Public Representative (P-Rep) elections.

The giveaway will last from August 26 to September 24 for IXC token holders who opt to participate in P-Rep voting.

According to the announcement, the giveaway is an effort to promote community involvement in the so-dubbed P-Rep elections, and to advance decentralized control of the network.

As per the announcement, ICX holders must participate in voting and staking in the upcoming P-Rep in order to receive tokens from the giveaway, so the giveaway acts directly as a participation incentive.

ICON Foundation founder Min Kim elaborated:

“With the giveaway, we expect not just to re-distribute 3 million ICX for better decentralization and voting capabilities, but we also hope to encourage current ICX holders and ICON community members to transfer their coins to ICONex wallet, so they can properly stake and participate in the upcoming P-Rep elections.”

As explained in a report by Decrypt, the Icon Foundation currently controls a lot of its coins, but not for long.

## DApp Connectivity 

Per the press release, Icon is a blockchain network that aims to connect blockchain projects together.
