# Price Analysis 27/07: BTC, ETH, XRP, LTC, BCH, BNB, EOS, BSV, XLM, ADA ...

###### 2019-07-27 13:07

If Bitcoin (BTC) breaks down of $9,080, which is the intraday low of July 17, we expect selling to intensify and the price to fall to the next support zone of $6,933.90-$7,451.63.

The price has again turned down from 20-day EMA and can now retest the critical support of $0.27795.

## BCH/USD

The bulls drove Bitcoin Cash (BCH) above the resistance line of the descending channel on July 26 but they could not scale above 20-day EMA.

If the price now plummets below the recent low of $0.0501579, it can drop to the next support zone of $0.036-$0.039.

However, if the support at $0.0501579 holds, bulls will again try to push the price back above 20-day EMA.

Though the trend in the ADA/USD pair is down, we are suggesting a buy because if bears cannot capitalize on the breakdown below the support of $0.0592761, it shows buying at lower levels.

The traders who have closed their long positions will be forced to get back in if the price sustains above 20-day EMA.
