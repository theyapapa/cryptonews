Huw van Steenis, senior adviser to Bank of England’s (BOE) Governor Mark Carney, told Bloomberg in an interview Monday, Jan. 21, that cryptocurrencies fail fundamental financial tests.

Van Steenis joined BOE in 2018, having previously worked at Schroders and Morgan Stanley.

When asked about crypto’s potential to become a threat to economic stability, van Steenis said:

“I’m not so worried about cryptocurrencies.

Van Steenis noted that registering new entrants into the banking system, especially technology firms, is one of the major challenges for BOE.

He also stressed that traditional banks are slow when it comes to adopting new technologies.

In March, the Treasury of the United Kingdom launched the Cryptoassets Taskforce, which is comprised of the Financial Conduct Authority and BOE, in order to develop a relevant legal framework for cryptocurrencies.

U.K. Finance Minister Philip Hammond said in a statement that the new crypto task force will work on creating industry standards for facilitating fintech and bank collaborations, as well as supporting innovation throughout the fintech industry.
