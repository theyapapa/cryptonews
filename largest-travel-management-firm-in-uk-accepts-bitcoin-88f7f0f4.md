###### 2019-04-15 21:04

Corporate Traveller, the largest travel management firm in the United Kingdom, is now accepting Bitcoin (BTC) for payments, according to a press release on April 15.

A newly announced partnership with crypto payments company BitPay will allow Corporate Traveller — which provides business travel management services to SME companies — to accept bitcoins.

Andy Hegley, U.K. General Manager at Corporate Traveller said:

“We identified an increasing demand from our clients for the option to pay in bitcoin for business travel bookings made by our travel consultants.

According to the press release, Corporate Traveller is unconcerned with price volatility in crypto markets, as the bitcoins will be converted directly into British pounds.

BitPay purportedly charges a 1% commission to convert the funds, which Corporate Traveller says is cheaper than credit card processing.

Other firms and organizations in the tourism and travel industries have begun accepting cryptocurrencies, citing customer demand.

In March 2018, the German National Tourist Board announced that it takes bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies as payment for its services.
