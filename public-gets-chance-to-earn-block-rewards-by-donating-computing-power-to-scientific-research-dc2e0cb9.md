# Public Gets Chance to Earn Block Rewards by Donating Computing Power to Scientific Research ...

A startup has unveiled bold plans to tackle the excessive levels of energy consumption seen in cryptocurrency mining, all while giving everyday computer users more of a chance to receive block rewards.

Resistance argues that proof-of-work mining “has been hijacked by huge mining farms using tons of energy to take control of the market” — isolating normal consumers who cannot afford to get involved with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

As a result, Resistance is seeking to address exorbitant energy consumption and the power imbalance within the mining community by offering a “radical concept” known as proof-of-research.

Known as PoR for short, proof-of-research enables anyone to donate their computing power to scientific research projects, meaning that the electricity consumed is devoted to performing mathematical equations that further our understanding on issues with a real-world impact.

Resistance acknowledges that there is value in the algorithms performed during proof-of-work (PoW) mining — as they help to keep networks like Bitcoin secure — but argues that this method is in dire need of an update.

Volunteers who contribute computing power through PoR have the opportunity to back scientific projects such as the World Community Grid, which has been responsible for dozens of research projects on humanitarian challenges — including renewable energy, cancer, HIV/AIDS and the Zika virus.

Resistance hopes to tackle the “obscene” amounts of energy currently being expended in crypto mining and makes humanity “healthier, happier and significantly more sustainable” — and the organization’s chief executive, Anthony Khamsei, is set to discuss the issue of high energy consumption in crypto mining during the World Economic Forum in Davos later in January.
