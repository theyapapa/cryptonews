In Malta, new rules will require that all property rental contracts be registered on a blockchain for security considerations, local news outlet Malta Today reported on June 23.

Malta’s Prime Minister, Joseph Muscat said that the cabinet approved new regulations, which will be announced over the coming days, that require rent contracts be registered on a blockchain to protect them from tampering and ensure authorized access.

Malta has established itself as a blockchain and digital currency-friendly country, and has become known as a “blockchain island.”

Integration of blockchain technology into real estate-related processes has been gaining traction in recent months.

Earlier in June, the Dubai Land Department and telecoms firm Etisalat signed a memorandum of understanding concerning real estate blockchain tech.

Last month, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) detailed several blockchain use cases relevant to the real estate industry in a report shared with Cointelegraph.

The EEA believes that blockchain has the potential to shorten the process of recording and transferring properties while increasing transparency and making land registries trustless, among other issues.
