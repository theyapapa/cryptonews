Major crypto platform Coinbase has opened its Coinbase Earn program to the public in over 100 countries, according to a press release on May 17.

As Cointelegraph reported, Coinbase first announced the program at the end of 2018 as an invite-only initiative.

Coinbase stated that according to a survey they conducted, uninformed users were reluctant to invest in crypto but were eager to learn:

“...one of the biggest barriers preventing people from exploring a new digital asset was a lack of knowledge about that asset.

Many of the people we surveyed expressed a strong desire to begin learning about new and different crypto assets beyond Bitcoin, but didn’t know where to begin.”

As the title implies, Coinbase Earn users can also earn crypto.

Earlier this week, Coinbase added trading support for 50 new jurisdictions, as well as USD Coin (USDC) trading options in 85 new countries.

In its press release announcing the expansion, Coinbase commented on its hopes for USDC to provide economic stability in these newly covered countries:

“For new customers in countries like Argentina and Uzbekistan, where consumer prices are expected to inflate by 10–20% in 2020, stablecoins like USDC could provide an opportunity to protect against inflation.”
