Most of the remaining top ten coins on CoinMarketCap are in the red, although remaining within a 1-4 percent range.

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has taken the heftiest hit among the top ten, down just under 4 percent to trade around $567, as controversies ahead of its forthcoming hard fork – scheduled for Nov. 15 – continue to divide the community.

Altcoins Ripple (XRP) and Stellar (XLM) are the only top ten coins in the green by press time, both up under 1 percent over the past 24 hours.

The top twenty coins by market cap are likewise almost unanimously red, with the exception of the 19th largest crypto, privacy-focused alt Zcash (ZEC), which is pushing 3.5 percent growth to trade at around $133.

Total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies is around $212.5 billion as of press time, down from an intra-week high of around $220.7 billion Nov. 7, but above the $207-210 billion levels it held throughout much of the past month.
