US Capital Global Securities (USCGS), offers investors a $10 million equities investment in a tokenized fund, reveals a press release published on July 29.

USCGS is a Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)-regulated affiliate of private investment bank US Capital Global.

Per the release, USCGS is offering to accredited investors a $10 million equity investment in the first tokenized venture fund of private digital venture capital fund CityBlock Capital, NYCQ Fund LP.

The fund, of which the institution is the exclusive placement agent, reportedly has holdings in major companies in the blockchain and financial technology industries.

According to the announcement, the fund includes holdings in U.S.-based crypto exchange Coinbase, digital asset platform and upcoming Bitcoin (BTC) futures provider Bakkt, crypto asset data company Nomics, and electronic brokerage Tagomi.

USCGS CEO Charles Towle commented on the development:

“Combining low minimum investment amounts and early liquidity opportunities, the Fund gives accredited investors access to blockchain infrastructure investments normally available to institutional investors.”

Earlier this month, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian’s venture fund led a $3.75 million seed round for blockchain-powered video game studio Horizon Blockchain Games.
