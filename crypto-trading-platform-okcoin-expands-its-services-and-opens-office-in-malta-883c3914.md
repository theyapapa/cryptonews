Digital asset trading platform OKCoin has expanded its trading services and opened an office in Malta, according to a blog post published on June 4.

OKCoin has launched its services to non-United States customers, who can now deposit and withdraw euros, as well as participate in euro spot trading for cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), and bitcoin cash (BCH).

Apart from expanding its trading, OKCoin has opened an office in Malta in the blockchain accelerator and hub dubbed chiliZ Blockchain Campus.

The new office will operate in compliance with the Virtual Financial Asset Act, regulated by the Malta Financial Services Authority.

Jovan Gavrilovic, general manager of Europe at OKCoin, said:

“Europe is essential to the evolution of the cryptocurrency markets.

Last November, OKCoin launched fiat-cryptocurrency trading services in Argentina, also revealing plans to extend its services all over Latin America, adding other local fiats to the list “in the coming months.”

As recently reported, Star Xu — founder of provider OKCoin and cryptocurrency exchange OKEx — announced OK Group’s partnership with blockchain-focused trust company Prime Trust, which will purportedly allow the firm to launch its own compliant stablecoin.
