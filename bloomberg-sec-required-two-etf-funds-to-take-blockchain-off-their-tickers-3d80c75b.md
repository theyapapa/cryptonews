The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reportedly required two funds to eliminate the word “blockchain” from their monikers, Bloomberg writes April 12, citing sources familiar with the matter.

The exchange-traded funds (ETFs) of both Amplify and Reality Shares reportedly mentioned blockchain in early filings.

Per Bloomberg’s unarmed interlocutors, the two funds were encouraged to change their names at the last minute in 2018.

Moreover, Bloomberg claims that there were other blockchain-related funds who eventually changed their names following the SEC’s request.

According to Bloomberg, the SEC is on high alert due to the growing number of ETFs launched by funds that offer to invest in a wide range of projects and services.

The number of assets in these funds has nearly tripled between 2014 and 2018, and more than 10% of new ETFs in 2018 targeted a particular theme, the media out states.

As Cointelegraph previously reported, in early 2018 the SEC had warned that U.S. companies who change their name to include the word “blockchain” would soon face increased scrutiny from the regulators.
