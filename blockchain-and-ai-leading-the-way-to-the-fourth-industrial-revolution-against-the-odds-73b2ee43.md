# Blockchain and AI: Leading the Way to the Fourth Industrial Revolution Against the Odds ...

###### 2019-03-19 09:03

Just as AI found its applications in the fintech sector as a data aggregator and automated solution determiner, so began blockchain in its permeation into areas of application where its properties can be of most use.

The AI can analyze large amounts of data and blockchain can serve as the immutable foundation for securely storing the records for use by various industries, since the Fourth Industrial Revolution is more of a breakthrough in data analysis.

Paul Lee, co-founder and CEO of Mind AI, an AI-powered platform, believes that blockchain plays an essential role in the process of making data management decentralized:

“We don’t see AI and blockchain as two separate, incompatible technologies, but rather as two technologies that can complement each other very nicely.

This also creates an uneven playing field in the advancement of AI technology, since data is the primary fuel that powers most modern AI systems.

And although the use of AI to collect personal information has become the most common way to use this technology, blockchain can help change the reputation of AI by storing the AI ​​mechanisms that process data on a distributed registry.

## Use cases

Despite the fact that blockchain and AI seem to be incompatible at first glance — the first is based on the principle of decentralized data storage, and the second allows information to be concentrated in the hands of centralized corporations — today, companies have learned to combine them in their processes.

Mind AI, a company that has invented an AI-powered solution aiming to achieve human-level reasoning, leverages blockchain to make the entire machine thought process transparent for average people.
