Insurance tech firm BlockClaim has recently received £500,000 ($627,000) in funding for its blockchain-based claims solution, according to an official blog post on June 17.

According to the announcement, BlockClaim uses blockchain technology to automate its claims process.

As per its website, BlockClaim uses a private blockchain to streamline the claims process:

“Leveraging the power of a private blockchain helps to keep data clean, speeds up processing time and increase claim auditibility in the ecosystem.”

For instance, the post says the BlockClaim system can make use of a type of image recognition AI module, in order to verify that images submitted in vehicle collision claims are accurately depicting the damaged vehicle in question.

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the United Kingdom-based insurance agency Legal & General is using Amazon Managed Blockchain to create a blockchain system for corporate pension takeovers.

Legal & General reportedly chose to use a blockchain solution due to the need for a secure ledger of transactions that could last a long time.

CEO of Legal & General Reinsurance Thomas Olunloyo remarked on the fittingness of blockchain for this goal, saying:

“... it allows data and transactions to be signed, recorded and maintained in a permanent and secure nature over the lifetime of these contracts, which can span over 50 years.”
