The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has published a memorandum, dated Oct. 9, from a meeting regarding the Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded-fund (ETF) proposal from VanEck and SolidX.

According to the document, on Oct. 9 SEC Commissioner Elad L. Roisman and his counsels Dean Conway, Matthew Estabrook, and Christina Thomas met with representatives from SolidX, VanEck, and the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE).

SolidX had filed for a Bitcoin ETF to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) as early as March 2016, but its application was rejected by the SEC in March 2017.

In June 2018, VanEck joined SolidX to apply for a physically-backed Bitcoin ETF to be listed on CBOE’s BZX Equities Exchange, the SEC’s decision on which is still pending since it was postponed in August.

The parties’ arguments as outlined in the memorandum comprehensively address the grounds the regulator had given in its 2017 disapproval of SolidX’s previous ETF application: a perceived failure to be consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act, which focuses on “prevent\[ing\] fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices.”

As reported in August, the SEC rejected nine applications to list and trade various Bitcoin ETFs from three different applicants, in part citing similar concerns over the lack of regulated derivatives markets of a sufficiently “significant” size.

VanEck, SolidX and CBOE’s representatives argued against this latter point in their memorandum, stating:

“As issuers, we are concerned the SEC staff have created a moving target in their use of the word ‘significant.’
