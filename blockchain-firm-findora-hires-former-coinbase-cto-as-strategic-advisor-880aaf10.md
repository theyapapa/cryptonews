Finance infrastructure-focused blockchain project Findora has appointed the former chief technology officer of major American cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase as a strategic advisor.

As fintech media outlet Fintech Finance reported on Aug. 14, Balaji Srinivasan joined Findora after serving as a general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, and co-founder and CEO of blockchain-powered paid messaging service Earn.com.

Apart from Srinivasan, Findora has also hired Dan Boneh, head of Stanford University’s Cryptography Group, to the same position.

Commenting on the appointment, Findora CEO Charles Lu reportedly said:

“We are excited to welcome Professor Dan Boneh and Balaji Srinivasan to our team as we work towards a new global financial system where users control their own financial data, identity and assets.

Earlier in August, Coinbase Custody Trust Company appointed two new members, previously of the New York State Banking Department and the New York Department of Financial Services, to its board of directors.

Also this month, Bitcoin.com appointed Stefan Rust as the company’s new chief executive officer as Roger Ver leaves the post.

Rust will continue working on the development of the company’s new products and services that promote peer-to-peer electronic cash.
