Nigel Green, the CEO and founder of financial consultancy firm deVere Group, says that the new normal bottom for Bitcoin (BTC) price is $10,000.

## BTC price holding $10K level for 3 months

London business news outlet LondonLovesBusiness reported on Aug. 27 that Green said:

“Looking at its performance this year, I believe that the new normal bottom price for Bitcoin is $10,000.

Earlier this month Green also noted that “Bitcoin can be expected to imminently reach $15,000.”

Namely, the United States-China trade war, Brexit, technical network improvements, the 2020 Bitcoin halving and public awareness growth.

He believes that investors will seek shelter in politically-neutral cryptocurrency like Bitcoin as it is showing to be one of the least correlated assets to the traditional markets.

He concludes:

“There is increasing global acceptance that cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, are not only the future of money, but increasingly the money of today.

This will be reflected in Bitcoin’s new normal bottom price of $10,000.”
