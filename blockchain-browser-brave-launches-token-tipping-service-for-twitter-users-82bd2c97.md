# Blockchain Browser Brave Launches Token Tipping Service for Twitter Users ...

###### 2019-08-01 20:08

The blockchain-based decentralized internet browser Brave now allows Twitter users to tip content creators with its native Basic Attention Tokens (BAT).

Brave discussed the public launch of its token tipping service in an announcement on Aug. 1, wherein users can reportedly specify the amount they wish to tip a given Twitter account, and the recipient will receive their tip in BAT directly.

Brave began testing its Twitter tipping service in May on its testing and development browser version called Brave Nightly.

As detailed in the announcement, the new feature comes as new in-browser offering via Brave Rewards.

Users who have opted into Brave Rewards will now see a tip option on Twitter posts when viewing Twitter through their Brave desktop browser.

Brave Rewards users can also earn the token by watching privacy-preserving ads or through traditional purchases.

The first app on the Props network is reportedly YouNow â€” a streaming service that now offers token rewards in exchange for streaming.
