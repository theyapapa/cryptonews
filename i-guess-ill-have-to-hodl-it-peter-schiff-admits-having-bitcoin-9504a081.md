# ‘I Guess I’ll Have to Hodl It’ — Peter Schiff Admits Having Bitcoin ...

###### 2019-07-05 03:07

Veteran gold bug and bitcoin (BTC) skeptic, Peter Schiff, has taken delivery of $1,350 worth the cryptocurrency after the industry sent him donations on July 4.

Schiff, who is well known for warning investors not to trust bitcoin as replacement for gold, triggered the goodwill gestures after becoming the topic of a Twitter debate with Morgan Creek Digital co-founder, Anthony Pompliano.

Pompliano (also known as Pomp), highlighted the fact that Schiff in fact does own some BTC despite his negative comments.

Schiff responded that it was a token amount given as a gift - just $100 - after which Pompliano requested his BTC address in order to double it.

At press time Friday, Schiff’s wallet contained at balance of $1,350 (0.124 BTC) after 52 transactions.

Signs Schiff is in fact not entirely anti-bitcoin, meanwhile, have been evident for some time.

Schiff Gold, for example, even offers it as a payment method.
