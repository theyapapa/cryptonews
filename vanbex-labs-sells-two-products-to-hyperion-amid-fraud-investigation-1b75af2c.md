Securities and cryptocurrency exchange Hyperion Technologies acquired two products developed by blockchain consulting firm Vanbex Labs, which is currently under investigation in British Columbia.

Vanbex announced in a post published on its blog on Sept. 4 that Hyperion had acquired Vanbex’s blockchain solutions Rocket and CryptoTaxes.

## Scam allegations

Additionally, according to the office, the company received $22.5 million in the alleged crypto fraud, and attempted to liquidate their assets in response to an investigation by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

Per the release, Rocket is a product meant to aid in smart contract development and deployment, as well as in the issuance of crypto assets.

The two products will be available through Hyperion’s platform for the FUEL token which has been launched by the firm in 2017.

## Firm’s scope expansion

Hyperion said that, with the acquisition, its platform became ready to cover all the needs of companies looking to issue a digital asset, raise funds in the marketplace, and list it on a regulated exchange.

Vanbex will continue to operate as a blockchain consulting company with a focus on supporting Hyperion’s growth.
