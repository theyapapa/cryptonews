The U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) will host a two-day blockchain workshop in February, according to an official request for information (RFI) posted Nov. 19.

DARPA, the research arm of the U.S. Department of Defense, is looking to to investigate technologies for distributed consensus during a workshop “tentatively scheduled for February 14 and 15, 2019, in Arlington, VA.”

As stated in the five-page RFI released by the agency’s Information Innovation Office (I2O), “of particular interest to DARPA are so-called ‘permissionless’ distributed consensus protocols.”

The report further indicates that while there is a “substantial amount” of research in the field, the federal agency is interested in “several, less-explored avenues of permissionless distributed consensus protocols.”

I20’s request for information covers three different topics – each of which is set to constitute a session at the agency’s workshop –the first of which is incentivizing distributed consensus protocols without the use of money.

The second subject covered in the RFI is economic-driven security models for distributed computation protocols, asking for information about “methods that leverage rigorous economic notions to advance theories of security for distributed, permissionless computation protocols.”

The third, and last topic on which the agency requested information covers the “centralities of distributed consensus protocols.”

The RFI also recognizes the potential of blockchain technology for data security and storage “resilience” for the government department, stating:

“Technologies for distributed consensus protocols have been revolutionized by their prominent role in cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies.
