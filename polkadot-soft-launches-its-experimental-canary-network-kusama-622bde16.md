# Polkadot Soft-Launches Its Experimental ‘Canary Network’ Kusama ...

Blockchain interoperability protocol, Polkadot, launched its experimental “canary network” dubbed Kusama, this morning, Aug. 23.

## Limited functionality for soft launch

In order to get off the ground, Kusama was begun as a Proof-of-Authority (PoA) network.

During this initial period much of the functionality is disabled, most notably balance transfers and governance.

Effectively, this will transform Kusama from a centralized PoA network to a decentralized Proof-of-Stake (PoS) network.

At this point, governance and transfers will be activated, and the Kusama network will be functionally live.

## Canary Network

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the Kusama “canary network” is a conscious decision to eschew “fake” test-nets and “step into this unknown and see what chaos awaits.”

Kusama will only exist as long as there is community demand, and Polkadot expects it to unlock new, high-risk functionality and projects that would serve as a preparation stage for development and deployment on Polkadot.
