Payments company Square has generated $125 million in Bitcoin (BTC) revenue in the second quarter of 2019 through its mobile payments service Cash App.

According to the letter, the company’s Bitcoin revenue benefited in part from the number one cryptocurrency’s price rally over the quarter.

This means that Bitcoin revenue granted the company over 92% of the quantity that Square obtained through subscription, services and transaction revenue alone.

In Square’s Q1 2019 report in May, the company revealed that it achieved a new revenue high from Bitcoin sales via Cash App, with a stated Bitcoin revenue of $65.5 million.

This means Square has more than doubled its Bitcoin revenue compared to the preceding quarter.

## Square: a company bullish on Bitcoin

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Steve Lee, a project manager at Square’s crypto branch — Square Crypto — heavily emphasized the company’s belief in Bitcoin in an ask me anything session on Twitter.

Square also recently released a Bitcoin deposits feature on Cash App in late June.
