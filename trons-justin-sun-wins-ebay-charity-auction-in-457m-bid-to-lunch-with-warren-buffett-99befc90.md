Tron (TRX) founder and CEO Justin Sun has won an eBay charity auction to have lunch with renowned investor and Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett.

Sun reportedly bid a record-breaking $4,567,888 to win the charity auction, which has been held by Warren Buffett for the past 20 years.

Buffett’s wife is reported to have been a GLIDE volunteer before her passing in 2004, since which the investor has upheld his own commitment to the foundation, reportedly raising over $30 million to date in auction proceeds.

In a statement, Sun emphasized the importance of contributing to a foundation whose work provides holistic programs for the local community, noting that:

“BitTorrent and TRON’s US headquarters are in San Francisco, and bidding on this charity auction was a key priority for our team.

According to the press release, the auction was hosted in cooperation with the “eBay for Charity” initiative, which enables members of eBay’s online community to support their chosen charities both donate platform-derived proceeds and additional contributions to various causes.

In her own statement, Karen Hanrahan, CEO and president of GLIDE, underscored that 100% of Sun’s contribution would be used “to help people overcome barriers such as homelessness, addiction, hunger and social isolation and reach their full potential.”

For some in the crypto community, Sun’s charity lunch with Warren Buffett will recall the investor’s much-publicized negative view of decentralized cryptocurrencies.
