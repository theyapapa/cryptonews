# Tracking Drugs on Blockchain: How Significant Is Walmart and IBM's New Collaboration? ...

However, given that the pilot has been initiated under the terms of the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) and that it calls for the creation of "an electronic, interoperable system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs" by 2023, there's every chance that blockchain technology will be involved to some degree in the final system that's eventually established.

Asked why blockchain is likely a better proposition for tracking drug supplies than other new technologies, Merck's director of global communications, Charles McCurdy, told Cointelegraph:

"A permissioned blockchain network has the potential to create greater transparency, reduce the time needed to track and trace inventory, help determine the integrity of products (such as whether they are kept at the correct temperature), prevent and remove counterfeit drugs, and more."

KPMG — another participant in the pilot — is equally enthused by the promise shown by blockchain in the context of drug supply chains, and its U.S. blockchain leader, Arun Ghosh, explained to Cointelegraph via the email that DLT will help simplify such chains, which can sometimes operate in a convoluted manner.

However, in the case of the FDA's latest pilot, the platform being built will indeed be a (private) blockchain, rather than some other system that tangentially uses only one or two features of blockchain technology.

Also, according to KPMG’s Ghosh, the pilot will focus specifically on using blockchain tech to make the whole process of tracking pharmaceuticals more efficient and more reliable:

“The pilot is intended to explore how blockchain technology can help reduce the amount of time needed to track a product, make it faster to retrieve more accurate drug distribution information, increase accuracy of information shared among network members and prevent illegitimate products from entering the supply chain.

As Sharif explained, such a system would make it very hard to surreptitiously pass off counterfeit drugs as the real thing:

“Since in the US all new labels need to be registered and in Europe they are issued by the central authorities, it's going to be difficult for criminals to infiltrate the pharmaceutical supply chain.

## Good, but…

In the context of drug supply chains, the potential shown by blockchain technology is evidently large.
