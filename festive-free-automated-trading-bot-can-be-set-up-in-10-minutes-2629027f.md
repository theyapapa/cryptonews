# Festive, Free Automated Trading Bot Can Be Set Up in 10 Minutes ...

###### 2018-11-17 06:11

The team behind the Santa Bot says it takes about 10 minutes to set it up and configure the user’s desired trading parameters – such as pairings and profit targets.

A bot’s ability to trade is delivered through API keys from supported crypto exchanges, and the platform says this means it cannot access user funds or withdraw them without permission.

Unlimited numbers of bots and trading pairs are available to users, and they are also able to perform long and short strategies simultaneously if they so wish.

The company says bots can place up to 100 times more orders when compared to users who trade manually, and this is because bots can track market movements for dozens of trading pairs simultaneously.

Given the 24-hour nature of the crypto trading world, where dramatic swings in price happen at any time of the day or night, it is hoped the bot will help investors to stay on top of market movements even if they’re away from their computer or asleep.

## Getting used to the interface

Through the Trade Santa interface, users are able to review the most successful pairs on each exchange over the past 24 hours – or for more immediate analysis, over a three, six or 12-hour period.

As Trade Santa gains traction in the crypto community, the team says its platform will remain free.
