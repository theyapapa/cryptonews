Blockchain tech firm ConsenSys has joined news industry leaders to contribute to the creation of a new revenue-generating news platform by WordPress, according to an official press release published on Jan. 14.

ConsenSys has invested $350,000 in the new WordPress project called Newspack, an open-source publishing platform for news companies.

In total, WordPress’ parent company Automattic and its partners Spirited Media and News Revenue Hub have secured $2.4 million for the first-year funding of the initiative.

Apart from investing in the new proof-of-concept (PoC) initiative by WordPress, which is the world’s most popular website management system, ConsenSys will also provide the new publishing platform with a blockchain-powered native plugin for Civil.

Backed by ConsenSys, Civil will allow any interested newsroom to join its community-owned journalism network and archive their content on decentralized storage systems.

In October 2018, Civil had noted that it would create a blockchain-publishing plugin for Wordpress.

Released in 2003, the WordPress online content management system (CMS) is used by more than 60 million websites, including Time.com, CNN and Quartz.
