# Blockchain-Based Ad Startup to Refund Contributors if Development Milestones Aren’t Met ...

###### 2018-10-02 13:10

A digital advertising startup with the goal of “building a better internet” for web users, publishers and advertisers is embarking on the second round of its token offering – but with a twist.

For the second round of its token offering, Varanida is using a new hybrid model that blends the traditional format of initial coin offerings (ICOs) with DAICOs – a relatively new concept championed by Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin.

Varanida’s CEO, Anji Ismail, told Cointelegraph: “Our goal has always been to improve the way the digital market provides services and content, while treating privacy, data ownership, and online users’ experiences with the greatest respect.

This round of our ICO will get our team and contributors one step closer to fulfilling that vision, while making Varanida part of the evolution of ICOs.”

The startup hopes that this arrangement will enable its community of users to have a voice in deciding which milestones are achieved next – providing the Varanida team with insight into the features their stakeholders regard as critical.

## Putting an end to “bad ads”

Varanida says it wants to return control of the online experience to users – enabling them to decide when they receive ads, and who gets their data.

Round two of Varanida’s token offering ends on Oct 5.
