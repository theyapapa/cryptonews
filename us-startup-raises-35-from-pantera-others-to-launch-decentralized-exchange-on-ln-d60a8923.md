The United States-based startup Sparkswap has completed a successful seed funding round to create a decentralized exchange based on the Bitcoin (BTC) Lightning Network.

The startup intends to create a decentralized exchange that will be protected from hacks, while still processing transactions on blockchain.

Sparkswap started testing its mainnet on Jan. 2, 2019, which is driven by Bitcoinâ€™s Lightning Network.

Following the seed round, the company is going to open trading to the public.

In the beta stage, the transactions will be limited to the BTC/LTC trading pair while Sparkswap is testing its software.

Earlier this month, Radar, the startup behind decentralized exchange Radar Relay that raised $10 million last year, announced that it will soon release new Lightning Network developer tools.

As Cointelegraph previously reported, blockchain development company Lightning Labs announced the initial release of the Lightning Network offramp Lightning Loop in March.
