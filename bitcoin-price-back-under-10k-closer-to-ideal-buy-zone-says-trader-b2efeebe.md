The latest drop below $10,000 level was one of the many that occurred over the past 30 days as Bitcoin was hovering around the threshold since mid-August.

But despite price struggling to hold above the $10,000 mark, Bitcoin fundamentals have been continuously improving.

Moreover, Bitcoin’s dominance on the market has been growing over the past month, up from 65.2% to 69% at press time, according to data from CoinMarketCap.
