The Ontario town of Innisfil, Canada, is now running a pilot program which will enable residents to pay property taxes with cryptocurrencies.

Per the CBC, Innisfil, in partnership with cryptocurrency payment processing project Coinberry Pay, will allow its residents to pay property taxes in Bitcoin (BTC), wherein the latter will convert cryptocurrency to Canadian dollars and transfer payments to the town.

In the United States, the state of Ohio became the first to allow businesses to pay taxes using Bitcoin.

Businesses are allowed to pay 23 different taxes using the crypto through an online portal that was set up by the state treasury office.

In February, lawmakers in the state of California introduced a bill to allow cannabis-related businesses to pay fees and taxes in stablecoins.

Assembly Bill 953 would allow the state, city and county tax offices to accept cryptocurrency pegged to a physical asset or a fiat currency from cannabis-related companies seeking to pay their excise or cultivation taxes.

Earlier in March, Cointelegraph reported that the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), the governmentâ€™s tax collection service, was reportedly auditing investors in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.
