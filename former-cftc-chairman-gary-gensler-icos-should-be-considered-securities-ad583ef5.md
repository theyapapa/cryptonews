Former chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), Gary Gensler said that most tokens sold through Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) should be classified as securities, Bloomberg reported Oct. 15.

Should cryptocurrencies be considered securities, they would fall under the regulatory purview of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

He continued, stressing the necessity to ensure investor protection within certain blockchain applications, such as cryptocurrencies.

Gensler said:

“I think that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) need more protection, and probably more protection than even the oil markets.”

Gensler’s words echo a statement from SEC Senior Advisor for Digital Assets and Innovation, Valerie A. Szczepanik, who said that “if you want \[the crypto\] industry to flourish, protection of investors should be at the forefront.”

Speaking at a U.S. SEC and CFTC senate hearing in February, SEC chairman Jay Clayton said that while every ICO token the SEC has seen so far is a security, a distinction should be made between tokens and major digital currencies such as BTC and Ethereum.

In December last year, Clayton issued a public statement, concluding that most tokens sold in ICOs are likely securities under U.S. law.
