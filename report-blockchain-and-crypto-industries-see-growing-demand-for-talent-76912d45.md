A recent study by recruiting site Glassdoor published Oct. 18 found that crypto and blockchain-related job opportunities significantly increased in the U.S. this year, despite the slump in cryptocurrency prices.

Per the report, as of August 2018 there were 1,775 unique blockchain-related job openings in the U.S., while at this time last year there were 446 similar job ads, which represents a 300 percent year-over-year increase.

The top 15 cities together constitute 79 percent of blockchain-related job ads in the U.S., while the remaining 21 percent are distributed across the rest of the country.

The most in-demand blockchain roles are primarily technical and engineering, with software engineer as the clear leader, comprising 19 percent of total job listings.

More broadly, engineering, technology, and science roles represent 55 percent of total job openings.

In terms of predominating employers in the field, Glassdoor highlights blockchain software technology firm ConsenSys and IBM, with over 200 related job openings each, as well as crypto exchanges Coinbase and Kraken, tech company Oracle, and fintech firm Figure.

Glassdoor’s “Know Your Worth” tool revealed that the median base salary in the blockchain field is $84,884 per year, which is $32,423, or 61.8 percent, higher than the U.S. median salary of $52,461 per year.
