The formula employed by James considers the hash power of the Bitcoin network, the hashing power of an ASIC Bitcoin miner, and the efficiency of each miner in producing BTC:

\# units = global hashing power รท unit hashing power รท unit efficiency

Given the cost of Bitcoin mining, when its hash power is currently around 35 million TH/s and the value is $6,400, the breakeven cost of Bitcoin is in the $7,000 to $8,000 range.

The fact that the hash power of BTC has continuously risen throughout the bear market of 2018 demonstrates large activity in the global cryptocurrency mining sector and the confidence of miners that the industry will recover as the year comes to an end.

## Bitmain and its Antminer sold at a discount

BitMEX Research, a cryptocurrency firm that operates as a research subsidiary of major digital asset exchange BitMEX, disclosed in its paper in August that Bitmain, the dominant conglomerate in the cryptocurrency mining sector, has been deliberately selling its latest Bitcoin ASIC miner Antminer S9 at a lower price.

Whether the decision of the firm to sell its main ASIC miner with a low profit margin was to due to its competition or to clear its inventory, the end result was the distribution of an increased number of efficient and high performance ASIC miners to the global mining sector, which ultimately led to the increase in the hash power of the Bitcoin network.

The lucrative business model of Bitmain and its high profits led GMO and Samsung, two of the most influential technology conglomerates in Japan and South Korea, to enter the global cryptocurrency mining industry.

Samsung Electronics has allocated a portion of its foundry in Suwon, South Korea, to manufacture cryptocurrency ASIC miners, in partnership with emerging companies in the mining sector.

Most recently, Samsung signed a deal with Squire, a Canada-based crypto mining corporation that raised $19.5 million in August to develop cryptocurrency mining equipment, to manufacture ASIC miners on behalf of the Canadian firm.
