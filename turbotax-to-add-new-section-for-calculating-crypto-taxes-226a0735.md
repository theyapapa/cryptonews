United States tax preparation software TurboTax Online has reportedly partnered with CoinsTax, LLC to offer cryptocurrency tax calculation to its services, a press release reveals Monday, Feb. 4.

As the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has just opened tax return filing, TurboTax is launching a new section for crypto taxation.

Once calculated, capitals gains and income reports can be downloaded or uploaded directly into Form 1040 Schedule D.

CoinsTax owns Bitcoin Tax â€” an application that allows users to calculate capital gains and losses for Bitcoin (BTC), which will provide the necessary infrastructure to TurboTax.

CEO of CoinsTax Colin Mackie believes that the new section will make filing crypto taxes much easier and save customers a lot of time.

In November 2018, Ohio became the first U.S. state to allow residents to pay taxes using Bitcoin.

In late January, Coinbase added educational resources about crypto taxation for customers in the U.S., including the aforementioned integration with TurboTax.

In October 2018, an advisory committee to the IRS urged the agency to provide additional guidelines for the taxation of crypto transactions.
