# Crypto’s Merger Problem and What Can Be Done When M&As Go Wrong ...

That's because Coinbase is one of the largest companies in the industry, and seeing as how even it couldn't quite exercise enough due diligence in this case, it begs the question of what other players in the space are doing when they merge with or acquire other companies.

## Due diligence

What makes the Coinbase incident particularly interesting is that the San Francisco-based exchange was aware of Neutrino's links to Hacking Team prior to the acquisition.

This raises a further question: Should companies undertaking mergers or acquisitions perform due diligence in the areas of values and public image?

"Yes, businesses typically place high value on their reputations and good will," he told Cointelegraph, although he also explained that the level of due diligence can vary according to the companies involved and the type of merger they are pursuing:

"First, it’s important to note that all combinations of businesses are not the same.

## Redress

It therefore seems that Coinbase may have deviated from ordinary company practice in not considering the Neutrino merger "from the perspective of our mission and values as a crypto company," as Brian Anderson put it.

And according to Dan Zimmerman, a senior counsel at Akin Gump, they do have the option of legal action, although this is normally limited — as a practical matter — for serious cases where a decline in share price and company value can be demonstrated as having followed from a merger or acquisition.

Added to this, attempting to prevent an acquisition in a court of law places the burden of proof on the plaintiffs, meaning that this is a viable option only when shareholders have a solid case that a merger would be detrimental to them and the company.
