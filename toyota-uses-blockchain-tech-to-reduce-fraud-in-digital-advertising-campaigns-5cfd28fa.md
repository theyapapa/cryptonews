Japanese car manufacturer Toyota has partnered with blockchain advertising analytics firm Lucidity to cut down on fraud when buying digital ads, according to a press release published Oct. 16.

Formerly known as KR8OS, Lucidity was founded in 2017 in Los Angeles and offers an Ethereum blockchain solution to track supply chain payments, so advertisers can monitor how their funds are allocated.

Through the new partnership with Lucidity, Toyota and global ads agency Saatchi & Saatchi are reportedly looking to attain transparency in Toyota’s digital ad campaign buys and eliminate wasted spending.

Nancy Inouye, Media Director at Toyota Motor North America, reportedly told advertising trade publication AdAge that the campaign with Lucidity resulted in a 21 percent upstick in visits to Toyota’s website.

Tom Scott, Media Director at Saatchi & Saatchi, stated that "even with high standards of anti-fraud and viewability filters already built in, Lucidity was able to deliver significant value-add by further optimizing the campaign."

Blockchain has been actively deployed within the media industry to address transparency issues like fake traffic counts, bot clicks and domain spoofing, as well as audit ad transactions.

In June, global ad software giant Mediaocean partnered with IBM to use blockchain to bring transparency to the “entire lifecycle of an advertiser's media dollar flow.”
