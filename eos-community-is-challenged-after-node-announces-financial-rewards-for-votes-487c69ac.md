# EOS Community Is Challenged After Node Announces Financial Rewards for Votes ...

Specifically, Starteos, one of EOS’ officially sanctioned Block Producers (BPs), appeared to publically offer its token holders financial rewards in return for their votes.

Starteos’ vote-buying tendencies seem to fall in line with previous scandals centring around EOS: This year, the blockchain protocol reversed previously confirmed transactions and started an internal investigation after Huobi, its other BP, was accused of running a corruption scheme, among other things.

Hence, the EOS ecosystem rests upon at least two major entities: the EOS Core Arbitration Forum (ECAF) — effectively its ‘judicial branch’ — and BPs, who produce blocks on the EOS blockchain — just like miners do within the Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain.

On Nov. 8, weeks before Starteos published a Medium post explicitly describing how users can claim some of the revenue, EOS investor Maple Leaf Capital pointed out that Starteos was launching a slot machine DApp, where users allegedly could set Starteos as a voting proxy to obtain in-game tokens.

Later, on Nov. 29, the investor announced it would discontinue voting for Starteos, arguing that “swapping block reward for votes in gaming form is detrimental to the long-term economic value for the EOS.”

He wrote an open letter to EOS investors after contacting the Starteos administration and failing to receive a response from them, stating:

“If other BPs copy what Starteos is doing and launch a second or third BP themselves, we will soon end up with the large BPs being owned and run by the same handful of owners.”

Australia-based crypto persona Crypto Tim, who covers mostly EOS-related news, published a video titled “EOS BP Starteos Are Vote Buying,” which gathered some commentary from the community on Reddit and YouTube.
