###### 2019-03-06 08:03

Estonia-based digital trading platform DX.Exchange has added tokenized Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) to its services, according to press release shared with Cointelegraph on March 6.

The ETFs offered can now be purchased both for cryptocurrencies and fiat during trading hours as well as after-hours.

According to the press release, the introduction of tokenized ETFs on DX.Exchange complies both with the latest guidelines issued by the European Securities and Markets Authority and with the EU Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II.

The chief operating officer of DX.Exchange, Amedeo Moscato, stated that he believes that the latest move by the EU-regulated company opens the world of popular financial assets to crypto holders.

His statement reads:

“As of today, there’s over 130 Billion USD worth of Crypto that can now be invested in Digital Stocks and ETFs.

DX.Exchange states that adding ETF trading to the platform will attract investors seeking to benefit from a lower-cost venue for executing their trades.

However, the company plans to make trading available to United States-based customers in 2019, according to a tweet from its co-founder and CEO in early January.
