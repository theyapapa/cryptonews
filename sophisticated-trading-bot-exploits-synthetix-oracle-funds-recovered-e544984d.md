# Sophisticated Trading Bot Exploits Synthetix Oracle, Funds Recovered ...

When Ethereum-based synthetic asset issuance platform Synthetix, which allows users to mint and trade synthetic currencies in a peer-to-peer fashion, lost track of more than 37 million synthetic Ether (sETH) on June 24, the company stopped all trading on its platform.

Since Synthetix users trade assets that are representations of their underlying assets and track the prices of those assets, if a user trades sUSD into sBTC at $10,000 per BTC and the price goes up to $12,000 per BTC, they can trade that back into $12,000 of sUSD, making a profit of $2,000 sUSD.

Abra offers a service whereby users can receive exposure to any fiat currency (e.g., USD, EUR, PHP) or cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin (e.g., XRP, DGB) that Abra supports via smart contracts on the Bitcoin and Litecoin networks.

In this case, a Synthetix oracle, responsible for providing external data to Synthetix’s smart contracts, transmitted false data on June 25, which a bot took advantage of.

The bot owner's balance was inflated due to an incorrect sKRW price feed, which he then converted into an inflated amount of sETH, a synthetic asset that tracks the price of Ether by plugging into an oracle-backed price feed.

Each price error increased the bot’s trading profit by 1000x, so after three cycles the bot had made over $1b.”

Warwick also believes the fact that a trader could generate so much profit so quickly speaks to both the strengths and weaknesses of the Synthetix platform:

“Because there are no counterparties traders can make very large trades with low slippage, which means the system can handle large trading volume, potentially billions of dollars per day given the current throughput of Ethereum.
