After defending the breakout level of $167.20 for the past four weeks, the bulls are attempting to resume the uptrend.

The ETH/USD pair might face some resistance at the 50-week SMA, but we expect this level to be scaled.

Our bullish view will be negated if the bears reverse direction from the current levels and sink the pair back into the triangle.

Such a move will invalidate the breakout of the bullish pattern, which is a bearish sign.

Please use only 30% of the usual position size for this trade: if the cryptocurrency struggles to breakout of $400, traders can quickly raise the stop loss to reduce the risk.

The traders can buy on a breakout and close (UTC time frame) above $91 and keep a stop loss of $65.

Traders can wait for the price to breakout and close (UTC time frame) above $81 to initiate long positions.
