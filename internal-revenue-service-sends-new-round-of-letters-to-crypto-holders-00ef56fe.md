# Internal Revenue Service Sends New Round of Letters to Crypto Holders ...

###### 2019-08-25 12:08

These notices were sent to traders of some crypto exchanges due to inconsistencies found in their tax reports.

Using the information provided by third-party systems — such as crypto exchanges and payment systems — the IRS has been able to determine the amounts traders owe and included the amounts in dollars in the notices.

The regulation stipulates that all broker and barter exchange services are required by law to annually report trader activity on a 1099-B form, send it directly to the IRS and send a copy to the recipient.

In crypto, the IRS still didn't publish clarification whether exchanges should provide 1099-K or 1099-B.

The users, at the same time, don't submit the IRS their copy of 1099-K, as they only use this form to calculate and report on their capital gains or loss report.

In the U.S., data gathered from these exchanges is collected by the IRS and compared to every trader’s 1099-K report.

If the reports do not match the data provided by the exchanges, the IRS will send the CP2000 notice to traders.
