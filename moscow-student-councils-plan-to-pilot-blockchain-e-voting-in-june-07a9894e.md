Authorities of Moscow are planning to pilot blockchain-based electronic voting in university student council elections in late June 2019, establishing methods that the cityâ€™s mayoral election may be next to apply, Russian news agency TASS reported on May 6.

According to the report, the project is set to be tested with the support of the Moscow Department of Information Technology (DIT) and the Moscow City Election Commission (Mosgorizbirkom).

Once the necessary legislation is passed and the commission approves the specifications, the DIT will launch the program in public, Kostyrko stated.

The city council of Moscow first submitted a bill to use blockchain in e-voting system in February.

In late April, the Russian Duma passed a bill allowing the Moscow City Duma to carry out such e-voting during the next elections on Sept. 8.

The Moscow City Duma plans to protect the process and results of e-voting with distributed ledger technology (DLT).

United Russia, the ruling party of the Russian Federation, launched a blockchain-enabled platform for e-voting in March.
