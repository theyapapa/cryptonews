The United States-based operator of crypto exchange Huobi, Hbus, has formed a new team to launch institutional products and services, according to a press release shared with Cointelegraph on March 27.

According to the announcement, Hbus is evaluating several potential services designed for institutional clients, including token lending and over-the-counter trading.

Mew says that Hbus’ decision to focus on institutional clients was made according to growing demand, as such customers need a secure and trusted marketplace to use crypto services.

Frank Fu, CEO of Hbus, says that the group, which will interact with "top investors," is now searching for more members with a strong background in financial services

Fu believes that the so-called crypto winter has in fact benefitted the industry due to the fact that only the most useful projects survived.

In February, digital asset management fund Grayscale Investments released a report that revealed significant investments in the crypto space made by institutional investors.

As Cointelegraph reported in late 2018, multinational investment bank and financial services company Morgan Stanley named cryptocurrencies as a new institutional investment class, noting the formation of new funds targeting the sector.

Earlier in 2019, crypto exchange Seed CX — a Chicago-based licensed platform targeting institutional clients — launched a digital asset wallet solution with on-chain settlement in partnership with its settlement subsidiary, Zero Hash.
