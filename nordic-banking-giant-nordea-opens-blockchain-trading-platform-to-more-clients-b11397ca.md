Nordic private banking institution Nordea is expanding its offering of the blockchain-based trading platform we.trade to its small and middle-sized business customers (SMEs), according to a press release on May 9.

The platform will purportedly help address trust deficits extant in current cross-border trades made by SMEs.

Patrik Zekkar, Global Head of Trade Finance and Working Capital Management at Nordea, explained:

“Almost 60 percent of the SME’s said that they have to make advance payments so there is obviously a sense of insecurity surrounding cross-border trade.

Through the we.trade platform, users can select certain events within a smart contract that will trigger a payment to another party.

We.trade is a joint project of 12 different banks including Deutsche Bank, HSBC, KBC, Natixis, Rabobank, Santander, Société Générale and UniCredit, and is based on the IBM Blockchain platform.

Nordea joined the project in 2017 and soft-launched it for select customers last month.

Nordea is a major private bank in the Nordic region.
