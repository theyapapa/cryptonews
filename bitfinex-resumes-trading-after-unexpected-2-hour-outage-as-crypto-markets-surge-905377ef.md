###### 2019-02-09 06:02

Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex notified users in a tweet Saturday, Feb. 9, that it had temporarily gone offline for all users, as crypto markets saw major gains.

However, about thirty minutes later, Bitfinex clarified that it had gone offline for all of its users, citing a “poor \[...\] choice of wording” as the reason for the misinformation.

After remaining inaccessible to users for a little over two hours, the exchange announced it is back up and running with full functionality.

Bitfinex is currently the world’s 18th largest crypto exchange by adjusted daily trade volumes, according to CoinMarketCap.

As Cointelegraph previously reported, the recent Exchange Security Report from independent analysts at ICORating has given 16 percent of the world’s biggest crypto trading platforms an A rating, and none of them an A+.

According to the study that reviewed 135 crypto exchanges, Bitfinex ranked 5th for most secure exchanges globally, with an A- rating.

According to the exchange, the firm has lost access to users’ funds — allegedly stored on cold wallets — because its CEO was the only person with access to them.
