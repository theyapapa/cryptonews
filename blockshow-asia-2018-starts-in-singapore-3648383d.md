BlockShow Asia 2018, dubbed “the largest blockchain technology roadshow” by tech news website Venturebeat, started in Singapore Wednesday, Nov. 28.

BlockShow Asia, powered by Cointelegraph, is returning to Singapore for the second time bringing together over 3,000 blockchain enthusiasts from over 50 countries.

On the first day the speakers will discuss, among other topics, the interaction between blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI), the impact of the Chinese crypto ban on the Asian crypto economy, millennials’ stance on cryptocurrencies, and blockchain technology transforming the gaming sector.

On the second day, BlockShow’s participants will debate the role of government in blockchain development, the evolution of crypto trading, the development of DApps, and the use of blockchain in major corporations.

Cointelegraph also spoke to Tom Lee, who remains optimistic about the direction of Bitcoin (BTC) despite the recent drop off in crypto markets.

Despite the ongoing situation, Lee expects BTC to be “one of the most profitable cryptocurrencies next year.”

The Cointelegraph team, which is currently in Singapore covering the event, will keep you informed about the highlights of BlockShow Asia 2018.
