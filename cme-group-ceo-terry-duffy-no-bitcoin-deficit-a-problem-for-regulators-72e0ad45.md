# CME Group CEO Terry Duffy: No Bitcoin Deficit a Problem for Regulators ...

###### 2019-03-25 15:03

Terry Duffy, CEO of leading United States derivative market CME Group, told Business Insider Monday, March 25, that Bitcoinâ€™s finite amount is a challenge for regulators.

According to Duffy, the inability to run Bitcoin (BTC) on a deficit is challenging for regulation.

Therefore, a major selling point of most cryptocurrencies, a limited supply, is an obstacle to their further adoption by state entities, according to Duffy.

He further added that regulators are still wary about cryptocurrencies, as they are still a relatively new financial instrument:

"I do believe that the regulators right now are a little careful about just rubber stamping anything as it relates to crypto.

Moreover, Duffy thinks that stablecoins pegged to the U.S. dollar or euro will gain more traction, as they have some of the characteristics of traditional money.

Duffy thus reiterated his stance from a February interview with Bloomberg, when he said that major commercial banks are not likely to get involved in the market unless the governments worldwide start accepting cryptocurrencies.

Many crypto entrepreneurs and financial experts opt for stablecoins as the best use case of cryptocurrencies.
