North Carolina-based Fluree has raised $4.7 million in its first funding round for the company’s blockchain-based database system, according to a report by Tech Crunch on June 3.

The firm’s blockchain database product, FlureeDB, purports to be “an immutable, time-ordered blockchain database” according to its documentation.

Additionally, users can reportedly choose to run the database privately or on a federated blockchain network.

However, Platz comments that using blockchain technology for databases is desirable, because of the trust and transparency that a blockchain provides:

“The real benefits it provides is immense integrity around the data, so you can prove it has never been tampered with, who put it in there, etc., something you can’t do with current databases or other data management technologies.”

According to an official Fluree blog post, software developer Lillian Podlog coded a cryptocurrency using FlureeDB in September.

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, United States-based tracking and shipping giant FedEx has been attempting to create a blockchain-based database.

However, FedEx blockchain strategist Dale Chrystie says there is a way to go before the blockchain-based alternative outperforms traditional methods:

“To kind of burst the bubble, it’s not our only database, it’s not our best database, it’s not currently very fast or very scalable and it’s not very mature, right?”
