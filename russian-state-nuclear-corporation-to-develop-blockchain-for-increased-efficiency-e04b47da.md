Russian state nuclear energy corporation (Rosatom) will develop "advanced" digital technologies, such as blockchain, according to Rosatom IT department head Evgeniy Abakumov, cited by corporate outlet Strana Rosatom Monday, October 1.

As per Abakumov, Rosatom intends to focus on three areas of new technologies, namely blockchain, artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things (IoT).

IoT, AI, blockchain and others are to increase the efficiency of manufacturing process," Rosatom’s IT department head said.

Abakumov also stated that Rosatom is looking to bring on new talent in the three aforementioned areas.

As Cointelegraph has reported, Russian official institutions are widely interested in crypto-related technologies.

For instance, the Russian state pension fund – the country's largest social service – revealed its plans to implement blockchain and smart contracts in labor relations this summer.

This past month, the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, which included high-ranked Russian managers from Forbes billionaires list, reportedly took part in creating an alternative bill on crypto regulation in the country.
