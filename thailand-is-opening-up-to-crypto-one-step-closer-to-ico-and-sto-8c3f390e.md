# Thailand Is Opening Up to Crypto, One Step Closer to ICO and STO ...

###### 2019-04-20 06:04

On Dec. 1, 2018, however, Cointelegraph reported that the Thai SEC declared Thai-related security token offerings (STOs) in international markets to be illegal and said that it will take appropriate legal action against companies that attempt to distribute STOs created in Thailand to overseas markets.

The government’s initial stance toward the approval of STOs in the local market contradicted the Thai SEC’s plans to legalize ICOs and allow companies to raise capital from investors in the public market.

With no major regulatory boundaries and with significant benefits in liquidity, fungibility and transportability, investors that have been involved in the traditional financial sector — like Hong Joon-ki, the CEO of over-the-counter (OTC) cryptocurrency exchange Cumberland Korea — have said that, eventually, various assets like artwork, real estate, sports teams and hedge funds will be tokenized:

“The global cryptocurrency sector will rapidly change to security tokens at an exponential rate.

## State of Thai regulation

Despite the shifting trend toward security tokens and the rising interest in tokenized assets in the global market, the current regulatory landscape of Thailand’s cryptocurrency market was nowhere close to permitting the distribution of regulated security tokens less than three months ago.

Conceptually, security tokens are similar to registered ICOs in the sense that both are cryptographically encrypted assets that operate under the guidance of the Thai SEC, given that only registered companies that meet the SEC’s criteria can run a token sale and that the sale is limited to accredited investors.

If the government determines that basic issues in the cryptocurrency exchange market, ICO market, and taxation are addressed and sufficient investor protection is imposed, then the government could shift its attention to emerging sectors within the broader cryptocurrency space, including security tokens.

With the G-20’s lead on cryptocurrency regulation, Thailand and other regions in Asia are expected to regulate their respective digital asset markets with stricter policies, and as a result, the Thai government could eventually get to security tokens in the long term.
