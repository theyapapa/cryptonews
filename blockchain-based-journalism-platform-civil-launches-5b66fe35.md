# Blockchain-Based Journalism Platform Civil Launches ...

###### 2019-03-06 15:03

Blockchain-based journalism network Civil has announced its launch in an official blog post on March 1.

Civil is a platform for independent journalism that aims to develop an alternative model to support journalism.

Starting March 6, users will purportedly be able to purchase Civil membership, including CVL which will represent members’ voting power within the Civil ecosystem.

“Thirty-four million Civil tokens will be priced by The Civil Media Company at $0.20 per CVL on March 6.

Apart from that, members will get an equivalent number of CVL to their financial contribution to the Civil Foundation.

Civil notes in the post that the recent development is not another “token sale,” likely referring to their ill-fated initial launch, when the CVL token sale targeting an $8 million minimum did not succeed last year.

Civil reportedly raised only $1,435,491 in CVL tokens from 1,012 investors, while an additional 1,738 buyers registered for the sale, but never completed the transaction.
