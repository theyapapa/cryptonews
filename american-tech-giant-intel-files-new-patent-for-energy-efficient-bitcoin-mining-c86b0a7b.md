U.S. technology giant Intel has filed a new patent for “energy-efficient high-performance Bitcoin mining,” according to a U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) filing published Nov. 27.

The Intel patent is dedicated to a “hardware accelerator implementing SHA-256 hash using optimized data paths” and aims to reduce energy for Bitcoin (BTC) mining up to 15 percent, according to the publication.

The documents states that “clusters of SHA engines may consume a lot of powers (e.g., at a rate of greater than 200 W),” adding:

“Embodiments of the present disclosure include energy-efficient ASIC-based SHA engines that consume less power for Bitcoin mining operations.”

Back this spring, Intel had already filed a patent aiming to reduce the amount of electricity consumed by crypto mining, “minimizing energy consumption per hash and maximizing performance per watt,” as Cointelegraph reported Mar. 30.

Previously this year, Intel partnered with Enigma, a decentralized application (DApp) platform, to launch its blockchain testnet to provide the first environment for scalable end-to-end DApps.

Another partnership with Intel was signed this fall, aiming to address “gaps in the market” for solutions that power enterprise blockchain systems, with software multinational company SAP.

Later in October, Intel partnered with hardware startup firm Ledger to provide innovative solutions for digital currency and blockchain applications, Cointelegraph wrote Oct. 27.
