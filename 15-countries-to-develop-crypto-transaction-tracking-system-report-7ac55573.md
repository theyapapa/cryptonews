# 15 Countries to Develop Crypto Transaction Tracking System: Report ...

###### 2019-08-09 11:08

About 15 global jurisdictions, including the G7 countries, will reportedly develop a system for tracking crypto transactions to prevent illicit uses of cryptocurrencies.

The new system intends to collect and distribute personal data on individuals who conduct crypto transactions in order to prevent funds from being used for illegal activities such as money laundering and terrorism financing, the report notes.

While a number of global jurisdictions have not adopted regulatory frameworks in regard to the crypto space, the new international initiative is expected to contribute to the development of legal measures globally.

According to the report, a system of measures will be enforced after the policies are introduced in 2020.

## FATF and G7 support uniform crypto regulation

The FATF released guidance for a risk-based approach in regard to virtual assets and virtual asset service providers in June 2019.

In the document, the authority described a number of regulatory recommendations that should be applied in its 37 member nations, including monitoring and reporting suspicious transactions by local crypto service providers.

On July 18, G7 finance ministers voiced their concerns that cryptocurrencies such as Facebookâ€™s stablecoin project Libra risk upsetting the global financial system if they are not regulated strictly.
