# No, Bitcoin Price Is Not in a 2018-Like ‘Descending Triangle’ of Doom ...

###### 2019-09-12 01:09

A descending triangle is among the most famous classical “bearish” chart patterns used in technical analysis.

This pattern can occur in both uptrends and downtrends, often has receding volume before breakout (78% of the time), and is confirmed when price closes above or below one of the trend lines.

According to Bulkowski (the undisputed authority on chart patterns), descending triangles break up 53% of the time.

Even if price is forming a descending triangle on the current Bitcoin price chart, the odds that it breaks down are only 37%.

And in that vein, if the current pattern is viewed as a descending triangle then traders should expect the same result — a continuation of the trend, which means that they should be expecting the price to rise, rather than drop, out of the pattern.

Further, traders would expect the bottom line of the triangle to behave as significant resistance on the first retest.

## A pattern is not a pattern until it is confirmed

A descending triangle is nothing more than a consolidation pattern, and most often consolidation patterns result in a continuation of the trend.
