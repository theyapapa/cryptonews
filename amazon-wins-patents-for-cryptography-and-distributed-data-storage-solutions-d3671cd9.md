# Amazon Wins Patents for Cryptography and Distributed Data Storage Solutions ...

E-commerce giant Amazon has won two patents related to methods for protecting the integrity of digital signatures and improving distributed data storage.

The first patent document, first filed in April of this year, outlines a “signature delegation” method for “protecting the integrity of digital signatures and encrypted communications,” by allowing for the generation, distribution, validation, and revocation of one-time-use cryptographic keys.

As tech media platform Hackernoon outlines, Merkle Trees are a “fundamental part” of blockchain systems, as they allow for a large body of data to be efficiently and securely verified:

“The Merkle Root summarizes all of the data in the related transactions, and is stored in the block header.

According to the newly published patent document, Amazon’s proposed Merkle Tree-structured, encrypted system aims to tackle how to delegate signing authority from a central entity to the various subordinates that are authorized to sign on its behalf.

As the patent filing reads: “the signature authority provides a key-distribution service that distributes blocks of cryptographic keys to authorized signing delegates.

Beyond pursuing blockchain, cryptography and distributed data storage-related patents to expand its technological arsenal, Amazon has also filed for cryptocurrency-specific inventions.

In April, Amazon Technologies was awarded a patent for a streaming data marketplace that would enable users to receive real-time crypto transaction data.
