Stablecoins with a clear governance framework may be hampered by the uncertainty of the lack of regulation, according to the European Central Bank (ECB).

## Four major types of stablecoins outlined

On Aug. 29, the ECB released a new paper devoted to stablecoins, which it describes as digital units of value that are not a form of any specific currency but rather rely on a set of stabilization tools in order to minimize fluctuations in their price.

Specifically, the ECB outlined four major types of stablecoins including those specified as tokenized funds, off-chain collateralized stablecoins, on-chain collateralized stablecoins and algorithmic stablecoins.

## 54 stablecoins totally $4.8 billion in July 2019

According to the ECB’s data, there are at least 54 existing stablecoin projects, with 24 of them being operational.

Tokenized funds are the most popular stablecoin type, accounting for almost 97% of the monthly volume of all other stablecoin initiatives, according to the ECB.

## Uncertainties in the field pose major risks

In the report, the ECB emphasized existing uncertainties in governance and regulatory treatment of stablecoin projects.

On the other hand, stablecoins with a clear governance framework are also at risk as far as they may “nevertheless be hampered by the uncertainty relating to the lack of regulatory scrutiny and recognition,” which is specifically relevant in the event that financial institutions use the same tech for recording of traditional assets.
