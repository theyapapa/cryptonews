Two Chilean deputies have presented a resolution on blockchain adoption to the lower house of the countryâ€™s parliament (Camara de Diputados) on Thursday, October 4, local news website Fortin Mapocho reported.

The proposed blockchain resolution project was first registered in late August.

In the project proposal, the two presenting members of parliament (MPs) Miguel Angel Calisto and Giorgio Jackson, along with eight other MPs, appeal to the Chilean president Sebastian Pinera, urging him to implement blockchain in all public areas of the country.

Introducing the resolution to parliament, Jackson cited a recent report from the Chilean Economic Prosecution office, which stated that the maintenance of notaries had become too expensive for the government.

Earlier in May the president of the Chilean Central Bank stated that he was considering introducing cryptocurrency regulation in the country.

Neighbouring South American countries are also testing blockchain for public administration.

In July, Argentina announced the creation of a federal blockchain system back, while earlier this year, the Brazilian government stated it was planning move its popular public petitions onto the Ethereum blockchain.
