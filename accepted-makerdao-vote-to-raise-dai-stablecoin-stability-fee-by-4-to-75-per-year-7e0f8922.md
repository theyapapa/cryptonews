Users of Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) MakerDAO (MKR) have voted to raise the so-called stability fee for Maker’s DAI (DAI) stablecoin by 4 percent, according to the results of a recent poll completed on March 21.

The firm announced on Thursday that users had voted yes to the proposal to increase the stability fee by 4 percent, from 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent.

The reasons provided by the post are that the DAI’s exchange persists under one dollar, high inventory levels among market makers and prop desks, and insufficient impact from the previous fee increase.

The MKR token holder could choose whether to raise the fee by zero, two or four percent.

Lastly, the post admits that a 4 percent increase is “the largest one-time raise, and runs the risk of overshooting our estimate.

The MakerDAO token MKR, which grants voting rights, is currently ranked the 16th largest cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap and is up 1.12 percent at press time.

As Cointelegraph recently reported, MKR token holders already voted to raise the DAI stability fee to 3.5 percent this month.
