Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) have raised $20 billion since the start of 2017, which is $18 billion more than the previous year, according to a recent study by financial research firm Autonomous Research.

The study dubbed “Crypto Utopia” explores the cryptocurrency industry over the past year, focusing on ICOs and the regulation to which they are exposed.

Per the study, $12 billion has been raised through ICOs in the course of 2018, while last year they raised $7 billion.

The research notes that ICOs are often exposed to fraud and scams, which form 20 percent of project white papers, while phishing and hacking are responsible for stealing 15 percent of all crypto assets by market capitalization.

More than 50 percent of ICOs have failed to raise funds and subsequently have closed.

Another study by Autonomous Research published last month stated that funding in ICOs has seen its hardest slump in 16 months, stating that in August startups raised $326 million, which is the smallest amount since May 2017.

In August, ICORating published a study showing that the ICO market more than doubled in a year.
