# Abra Restricts Americans From Holding EOS and 4 Other Altcoins ...

###### 2019-07-26 08:07

California-based crypto wallet service Abra will restrict some services for American users starting from August.

## U.S. users canâ€™t hold certain altcoins

Specifically, the platform will start migrating its smart contract-based synthetic assets to a native hosted wallet solution, adding that those assets are defined on Abra as anything other than Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Litecoin (LTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH).

This migration will have a direct impact on some services for U.S. users, including restriction from holding five cryptocurrencies.

## But Bitcoin and a few major altcoins are okay

As such, after Aug. 29, New York residents will only be able to hold Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash on Abra, the company stated.

Additionally, Abra users from New York will no longer be able to use ACH transfers, as well as wire or American express for deposits and withdrawals after Aug 29th, 2019.

At the same time, the migration process is expected to be seamless for the majority of U.S. users, and will allow users to continue managing operations with no interruption.

However, many of those new services will not be available in the U.S., the company said.
