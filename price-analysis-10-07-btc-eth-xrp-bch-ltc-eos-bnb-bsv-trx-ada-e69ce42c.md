# Price Analysis 10/07: BTC, ETH, XRP, BCH, LTC, EOS, BNB, BSV, TRX, ADA ...

###### 2019-07-10 15:07

Responding to a query on Twitter, the European Central Bank said that Bitcoin is “not a currency.”

If the BTC/USD pair slips below $12,000, the first support on the downside is at 20-day EMA.

The bears have broken down of 20-day EMA and the price is likely to drop to the support at 50-day SMA.

## XRP/USD

Ripple (XRP) turned down from the 20-day EMA on July 9 and has plummeted below the first support of $0.37835.

Contrary to our assumption, if the bulls defend the support line of the channel, the pair might move up to the moving averages, above which a rally to $450 is probable.

## LTC/USD

Litecoin (LTC) turned down from the 20-day EMA on July 9 and has plunged below the support at $111.8994.

## BSV/USD

Bitcoin SV (BSV) rose above 20-day EMA on July 9 but bulls could not sustain the higher levels, which shows lack of buying interest.
