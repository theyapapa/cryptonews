# Report: New Zealand Cryptopia Exchange Hack Continues ...

###### 2019-01-29 21:01

Two weeks after it first reported a hack, New Zealand-based cryptocurrency exchange Cryptopia is still compromised by cyber criminals, according to a blog post from blockchain infrastructure firm Elementus on Jan. 29.

Cryptopia stated that the hack occurred the previous day on Jan. 14.

On Jan. 20, Elementus reported that as much as $16 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) and ERC20 tokens were stolen.

Per the blog, data on the Ethereum public blockchain indicates that funds began to be siphoned from Cryptopia’s two core wallets — one holding ETH, the other tokens — on the morning of Jan. 13.

In today’s post, Elementus says that the attack is continuing and that hackers have stolen 1,675 ETH ($175,875) from 17,000 Cryptopia wallets, accumulating at this address.

Elementus says that it was apparent that the same hacker or hackers are responsible for the continued security breach, as the funds have been transferred to the address used in the initial hack.

The blog concludes that Cryptopia does not have control over its Ethereum wallets, while the hacker still does.
