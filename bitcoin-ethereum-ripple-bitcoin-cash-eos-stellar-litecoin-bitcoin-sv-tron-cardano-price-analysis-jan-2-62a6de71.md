A breakout of this level will complete an inverse head and shoulders pattern that has a pattern target of $0.52205 with a minor hurdle at the resistance line of the descending channel.

Therefore, short-term traders can wait for a close (UTC time frame) above the 50-day SMA to buy.

On the downside, if the bears sink the EOS/USD pair below the 20-day EMA, it can drop to $2.1733 and below this level, a retest of $1.55 is probable.

On the other hand, if the bulls fail to break out of the neckline of the inverse head and shoulders pattern, the bears will attempt to plunge the LTC/USD pair below $28.067 that can result in a retest of the low.

## ADA/USD

Cardano has been trading between the 20-day EMA and the neckline of the inverse head and shoulders pattern.

Due to the tight consolidation near the neckline, we expect the ADA/USD pair to scale the immediate resistance of $0.060105 and rally towards the pattern target of $0.066.

However, if the digital currency fails to breakout of the neckline and slumps below the 20-day EMA, it can decline to $0.036815 and below this level, it can drop to $0.027237.
