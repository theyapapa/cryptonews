Today, digital asset management fund Grayscale Investments will transfer nearly $3 billion worth in cryptocurrency holdings to American major crypto wallet provider and exchange exchange Coinbase.

As Forbes reported on Aug. 2, Grayscale is going to move almost $3 billion worth of its digital currency holdings, including Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ether (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and Ripple (XRP), among some other tokens, to Coinbase, wherein Coinbase Custody will serve as custodian of the underlying assets for the company’s products.

Together with its cryptocurrency holdings, Grayscale will transfer its publicly quoted cryptocurrency trusts and its Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund to Coinbase.

Commenting on the deal, Sam McIngvale, Coinbase Custody chief executive, said:

"As a NY State-chartered trust company, Coinbase Custody is held to the same fiduciary standards as national banks.

## Hitting new records

In mid-July, Grayscale recorded an all-time high volume of assets under management of $2.7 billion.

As previously reported, Grayscale Investments’ Bitcoin Trust was up almost 300% on the year as of July 9.

Coinbase Custody revealed in June that it held $1.3 billion in assets under custody and the firm expected to hit $2 billion AUC soon.
