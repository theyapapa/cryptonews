## Bitcoin primed for fresh bull market

Data from Coin360 showed BTC/USD coming off local highs around $10,750 to float around $10,520 on Wednesday, still up almost 10% versus the start of the week.

PlanB, the Twitter account well-known for its analysis of Bitcoin’s stock-to-flow ratio, concluded current conditions translated into the beginning of a fresh bull market.

That particular metric is significant for PlanB, as lows consistently coincided with the beginning of Bitcoin price ascents to new highs.

“The 20 WMA (also the middle of the weekly Bollinger Bands) has proven to be important in Bitcoin’s cycles; supporting price in a bull market and suppressing price in a bear market,” he explained in his latest newsletter.

Filb added:

“My overall market assumption is that we are in the early phase of the next Bitcoin cycle.”
