# Price Analysis 12/08: BTC, ETH, XRP, BCH, LTC, BNB, EOS, BSV, XMR, XLM ...

###### 2019-08-12 13:08

On the other hand, if the price fails to sustain above the uptrend line, bears will again attempt to break below the next support of $192.945.

## LTC/USD

The bulls are defending the support at $83.65 while bears are defending the 20-day EMA.

However, if the price moves above the 20-day EMA, the LTC/USD pair might consolidate between $83.65 and $105.676 for a few days.

If bulls can push the price above the 20-day EMA, the cryptocurrency can reach the 50-day SMA, which is close to the horizontal resistance of $4.8719.

## BSV/USD

Bitcoin SV (BSV) has been trading between the support of $136.89 and the 20-day EMA for the past few days.

However, if the price breaks down of the 20-day EMA, it can drop to the support line of the channel.

This shows that bears are in command, but if the XLM/USD pair breaks out and closes (UTC time) above the 20-day EMA, it will indicate a likely change in trend.
