JP Morgan-backed digital services firm Smartrac has partnered with SUKU Ecosystem, a blockchain startup owned by former Deloitte exec Eric Piscini, according to a tweet on Tuesday, Jan. 22.

SUKU, which is parented by another Piscini-owned blockchain firm Citizen Reserve, will provide its platform to integrate with Smartrac’s supply chain.

Based on the public Ethereum (ETH) blockchain, Citizens Reserve’s platform is operating its own cryptocurrency, ZERV, which was developed on an ERC20 token.

Piscini, CEO at both SUKU and Citizen, said that the new partnership aims to resolve major problems related to supply chain digitization.

Per Piscini the new blockchain integration will improve tracking, security, and transparency across the supply chain.

Dinesh Dhamija, CTO of Citizens Reserve, said:

“The combination of Smartrac’s digital enablement capabilities along with Citizen’s Reserves’ SUKU platform will provide a unique identity for each physical product with a transparent and accessible supply chain solution.”

Deloitte, a Big Four audit and consulting firm, recently included blockchain technology in its Tech Trends 2019 report, stressing its disruptive nature and outlining blockchain as “the unsung hero of our digital future.”
