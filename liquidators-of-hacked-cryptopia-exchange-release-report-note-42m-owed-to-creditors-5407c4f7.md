The liquidators of now-defunct New Zealand crypto exchange Cryptopia have released the first report on the state of affairs of the firm, according to the documents published on May 31.

Cryptopia’s recently assigned liquidator, Grant Thornton, has released an estimation statement of the financial state of the firm, reporting that the hacked exchange owes a total of $4.22 million to its creditors.

In a press release accompanying the report, Thornton stated that the exchange liquidators, David Ruscoe and Russell Moore, are still in the process of securing and recovering the company’s crypto assets compromised from Cryptopia’s mid-January hack.

The report notes that liquidators were granted a court order from the New Zealand courts authorizing them to use certain crypto assets to recover and preserve assets.

As there is no legal precedent on crypto assets in New Zealand and worldwide, the distribution of those assets and the overall conduct of the liquidation will require significant direction from the New Zealand Courts.”

Following the appointment as the exchange's liquidator, Thornton warned that creditors would have to wait months, rather than weeks, to get their funds back.

Recently, analysts found that hackers have moved a portion of Cryptopoa’s stolen crypto assets to another crypto exchange.
