Founded in Finland in 2012, LocalBitcoins offers over-the-counter trading of local currency for bitcoin and operates as a P2P trading platform.

The Finnish crypto trading platform is especially popular in Latin America, with Venezuela and Colombia having reportedly accounted for 85% of LocalBitcoins’s trading volumes by February 2019.

According to data from crypto analytics website Coinhills, the South-Korean won is one of the most popular national currencies trading against bitcoin.

Accounting for around 20,000 btc ($173 million) in daily trading volumes against bitcoin, the won is ranked the third largest national currency traded versus BTC after the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen.

In mid-April, major South Korean crypto exchange Coinnest started closing its services, which was reportedly a result of the extended 2018 bear market.
