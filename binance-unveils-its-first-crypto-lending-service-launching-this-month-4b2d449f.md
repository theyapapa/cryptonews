According to an official announcement on Aug. 26, holders of Binance coin (BNB), Ethereum Classic (ETC) and Tether (USDT) will be able to lend their assets and earn interest through Binance’s new service called Binance Lending.

The first interest calculation period will be from Aug. 29 till Sept. 10.

Binance added that interest payout time will take place immediately after the loan term matures.

Binance gives an example:

"If User A subscribes to 10 lots of BNB Lending (total lend of 100 BNB), the interest earned at maturity date will be 0.057534 BNB x 10 = 0.57534 BNB.”

Also today, Binance updated its Lending FAQ by adding a new section “Binance Lending Service Agreement,” claiming that the Binance Lending assets will be used in cryptocurrency leveraged borrowing business on Binance.com.
