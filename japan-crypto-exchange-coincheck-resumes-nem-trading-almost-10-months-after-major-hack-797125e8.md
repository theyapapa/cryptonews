Recently re-opened Japanese crypto exchange Coincheck has announced it has resumed NEM (XEM) crypto token trading after a restructuring of its platform by external “security experts,” South Korean news outlet FNNews reports Nov. 13.

In January of this year, Coincheck suffered an industry record-breaking hack when $534 million worth of NEM was stolen from its wallets.

This latest development from Coincheck reveals the exchange has “joined the Japan Security Association and is “ready to renovate its image.”

Coincheck is quoted as saying that "technological safety has been verified through cooperation with external experts on NEM, Ethereum, and Lisk handling (on our exchange)."

As FNNews notes, Coincheck is a member of both the Japan Network Security Association (JNSA) and Japan’s Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA).

In April, Coincheck was acquired by Japanese internet broker Monex Group Inc. as part of a major rehaul of its shareholder composition and management.

On Oct. 30, Monex announced it had reopened new account signups and limited trading on Coincheck, beginning with purchases and deposits of Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum Classic (ETC), Litecoin (LTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH).
