Dublin City University has partnered with tech company network Technology Ireland ICT Skillnet to create the country’s first master’s program in blockchain technology.

The “Master’s in Blockchain: Distributed Ledger Technologies” degree is the culmination of ICT Skillnet’s efforts to identify the skills upcoming blockchain engineers need to learn, with the help of blockchain educational hub Blockchain Ireland.

The acting network manager for Technology Ireland ICT Skillnet, Dave Feenan, commented:

“This new Master’s will provide Ireland will a real opportunity to upskill our already excellent IT professionals, preparing them for jobs of the future.

The synergy between industry and education means these professionals will have the practical tools needed to bring the benefits of Blockchain technology to a variety sectors.”

The inauguration of the new master’s program occurred during Blockchain Ireland week, a governmental campaign to raise awareness and support for the blockchain industry in Ireland.

Last summer, IDA Ireland, an agency responsible for attracting foreign direct investment, began a campaign to promote the development of the blockchain industry in the country.

As recently reported by Cointelegraph, the United States Ivy League University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) has announced that it is offering an online program on fintech, which includes topics on blockchain technology and cryptocurrency.
