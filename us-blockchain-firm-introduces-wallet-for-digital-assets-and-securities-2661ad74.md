San Francisco-based blockchain firm TokenSoft has rolled out a beta version of its wallet for digital assets and digital securities, according to a press release published on Jan. 29.

The new product called Knox Wallet provides cold storage and a self-custody platform for managing multiple assets, including both cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (ETH) and Ethereum (ETH), as well as tokenized assets such as real estate, equity, or debt.

CEO of TokenSoft Mason Borda said that the secure storage of digital assets is of â€œcritical importance given that almost $1 billion of cryptocurrency was stolen by hackers in the first three quarters of 2018 alone."

A report by cybersecurity company Carbon Black found that roughly $1.1 bln worth of digital currency has been stolen in the first half of 2018.

In December, TokenSoft invested in a broker-dealer that is compliant with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The investment purportedly enabled TokenSoft to offer issuers the option to host a token sale themselves or work with a broker-dealer to carry out the sale on their behalf.

In mid-January, the Winklevoss brothers, Bitcoin billionaires and the founders of Gemini cryptocurrency exchange, predicted that both tokenized securities and stablecoins will contribute greatly to the evolution of digital currency.
