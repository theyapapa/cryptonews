# Japan: Self-Regulatory Group of Crypto Exchanges Set to Tighten Rules on Online Digital Asset Storage ...

The self-regulatory Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA) plans to stricten its customer asset management measures.

JVCEA is a self-regulatory group of some of the largest licensed exchange operators in Japan, established in April of this year.

Now, the organization is reportedly planning to tighten its rules by establishing a limit on the amount of digital currencies that can be managed online by any exchange.

Crypto exchanges normally store most of their customers’ crypto assets offline on cold storage wallets.

JVCEA’s new rules will limit the share of digital assets that can be stored this way by the organization’s member exchanges.

The push for stricter self-regulation comes after the recent hack of a Japanese crypto exchange Zaif that has lost 6.7 billion yen ($59.7 million) worth of crypto assets belonging to both the company and its customers.

Zaif’s hack took place after an even larger case earlier this year, when hackers attacked a Japanese crypto exchange Coincheck, managing to get away with $523 million worth of NEM coins.
