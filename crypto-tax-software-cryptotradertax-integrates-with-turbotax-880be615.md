Cryptocurrency-focused tax software CryptoTrader.Tax has integrated with leading American tax software Intuit TurboTax, according to a press release on April 4.

The integration will purportedly allow users to export tax calculations from CryptoTrader.Tax to the TurboTax filing software, which will supposedly make the filing process easier.

The software will automatically crunch your capital gains and losses numbers and generate the necessary tax documents including the IRS form 8949.”

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) — the agency responsible for collecting taxes and pursuing tax evaders — classifies cryptocurrencies as property when calculating taxes.

Earlier this year, major American cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase added resources for customers in the U.S. to claim crypto trades on their taxes.

In addition to adding an educational guide on crypto and taxes, Coinbase has also integrated TurboTax, allowing users to automatically import transactions into a crypto-specific section of TurboTax Premier.

In February, TurboTax itself partnered with CoinsTax, LLC to offer cryptocurrency tax calculation to its services.
