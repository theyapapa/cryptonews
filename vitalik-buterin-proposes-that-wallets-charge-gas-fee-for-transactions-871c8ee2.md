# Vitalik Buterin Proposes That Wallets Charge Gas Fee for Transactions ...

Ethereum (ETH) co-founder Vitalik Buterin proposed that wallets charge a gas fee for transactions in order to support developers in a tweet on March 8.

Gas is a unit for measuring the computational work of operating transactions or smart contracts in the Ethereum network, wherein different kinds of transactions require a different volume of gas to execute.

In the tweet, Buterin stated:

“I propose we consider supporting a community norm that client/wallet devs can/should charge a 1 gwei/gas fee for txs sent through their wallet, we don't try to circumvent such fees, and we support protocol changes to make such fees easier (eg.

abstraction enabling multisends)”

Buterin gave a broader picture of the proposed change, saying that increasing average user gas costs by around seven percent would raise up to $2 million per year in funding for wallet developers.

Buterin further explained his position:

“To be clear, I am NOT advocating a norm \*mandating\* the 1 gwei fee.

In March 2018, Buterin stated that he had been trying to solve Bitcoin’s limited functionality with the creation of Ethereum.

Constantinople is set to bring multiple efficiency improvements to the platform, including cheaper transaction fees for some operations on the Ethereum network.
