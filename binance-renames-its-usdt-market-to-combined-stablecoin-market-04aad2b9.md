# Binance Renames Its USDT Market to Combined Stablecoin Market ...

###### 2018-11-26 21:11

Major cryptocurrency exchange Binance has renamed its Tether (USDT) Market to be a combined Stablecoin Market (USDⓈ), according to an announcement published Nov. 26.

This will purportedly allow the exchange to support more trading pairs of stablecoins.

The exchange also notes that USDⓈ is not a new stablecoin, but the symbol of Binance’s new stablecoin market.

Binance will deliver a separate announcement about what exact pairs will be moved or added to this market.

The move follows the Nov. 15 announcement that Binance would start listing blockchain payment company Circle’s USD-pegged stablecoin USD Coin (USDC).

USDC token was launched collaboratively by U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase and Circle in October.

Coinbase President and COO Asiff Hirji said the company issued “stablecoins backed 1:1 with the U.S. dollar, completely audited, completely transparent.”
