# Crypto Regulation Experts Debate State vs. Federal Regulation in the Blockchain Era ...

###### 2019-05-03 20:05

Three cryptocurrency experts expressed diverging views towards United States crypto regulation at a panel during the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s (MIT) Business of Blockchain event on May 2.

Wyoming Blockchain Coalition president Caitlin Long argued that digital assets are property and thus should be regulated at the state level, with the approach that “states control property law, states control commercial law.

Gary Gensler, former chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and current MIT lecturer, was in favor of federal regulation specifically for cryptocurrency exchanges, reasoning:

“One, I think that we do need the investor protection at the crypto exchanges, and two, on the money-laundering side, right now the crypto exchanges are required to register at any state they’re transmitting over some de minimis amount and that means in 50-plus jurisdictions”

Long preferred keeping such organizations subject to state regulation “because digital assets are property, and that has historically been the purview of the states.”

When asked what distinguishes the work of U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase from PayPal and other federally regulated companies do, Long said:

“They’re not handling dollars.”

When Gensler suggested that crypto exchanges should comply with the Bank Secrecy Act, Long answered that she expects that act to be struck down the next time it is challenged, citing the miniscule conviction rate that it has produced.

Long’s home state of Wyoming traditionally employs low-tax, low-regulation legislation.

In January, the state passed two new house bills aimed at fostering a regulatory environment conducive to cryptocurrency and blockchain innovation.
