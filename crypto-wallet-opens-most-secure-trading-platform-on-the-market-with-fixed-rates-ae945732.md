The MUI Token is a new ERC-20 compliant token, known as MUI, the company’s own cryptocurrency.

The first product that was announced by the company was SovereignWallet.

The company said that transferring funds via SovereignWallet is as simple as “sending a text,” because the M-DEX exchange platform is integrated with the online wallet.

The SovereignWallet network ecosystem is powered by the company’s own cryptocurrency MUI Token.
