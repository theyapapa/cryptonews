Major United States energy firm Ameren and Canadian software engineering and solutions company Opus One Solutions will explore the potential use of blockchain technology.

Ameren, which currently services around 2.4 million electric and 900,000 gas consumers, will examine blockchain as one of a range of options in its clean energy initiative.

Blockchain is set to feature in the firms’ so-called Transactive Energy Marketplace (TEM), a microgrid built using Opus One’s technology to improve supply and demand ratios.

“Identifying the value local distributed energy resources (DER) can provide to our distribution system and the customers it serves, helps inform how and where customers should invest in clean renewable power,” Ron Pate, senior vice president of operations and technical services at subsidiary Ameren Illinois, commented in the press release.

He continued:

“Transactive energy markets will ensure that distributed energy resources are compensated appropriately, for the services that they provide.”

The plans do not yet explicitly state how Ameren plans to leverage blockchain, yet come as energy providers worldwide turn to the tech to reshape their operations.

As Cointelegraph reported earlier this month, Japan’s Marubeni has partnered with a blockchain firm, LO3, in its own bid to increase the automation and efficiency of its renewable energy offering.
