JPMorgan Chase (JPM) is expanding the use of its blockchain technology to help reduce the number of global payments rejected by errors, the Financial Times reported on April 21.

The United States financial giant is adding new features to its Interbank Information Network (IIN,) which is now used by more than 220 banks around the world.

The technology was initially designed to help institutions share payments data in real time — cutting delays in processing times.

John Hunter, JPM’s head of global clearing, said it has built a new feature that can instantly verify whether a payment is heading to a valid bank account.

As reported by Cointelegraph in January, experts at the financial institution believe the technology will provide benefits to banks and financial systems.

In February, the banking giant announced it was launching its own cryptocurrency, dubbed the “JPM Coin,” to increase settlement efficiency.

Some crypto executives have been dismissive of the JPM Coin, with Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse claiming it “misses the point” of crypto altogether.
