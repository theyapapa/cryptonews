# Current Tether Supply Suggests Bitcoin Price Is Correcting to $20,000 ...

Bitcoin price charting on a longer timeframe, market structure and the issuance of 1 billion Tether so far this year are making crypto and equities analyst FilbFilb incredibly bullish on BTC/USD in the run up to the 2020 halving.

## 4 ways Bitcoin price structurally shifted in 2019

According to popular crypto and equities analyst FilbFilb, Bitcoin price has undergone a structural shift for several reasons, he explained in his weekly newsletter.

By starting at Tether’s market cap bottom and comparing this against the time it took Bitcoin to reach its 2018 bottom, FilbFilb’s notes that there is an approximately 32-day delay between Tether and Bitcoin’s price action.

## Mind the gap

By anchoring Tether’s market cap bottom to Bitcoin’s market cap bottom, the 30-day lag between the two assets is smoothed out to the extent that it is easier to determine the correlation between each asset.

Therefore, when applied to Tether’s current market cap of $40.04 billion, the model suggests that the price of Bitcoin should be somewhere around $20,000.

- If Bitcoin’s market cap continues to grow, the formula and analysis will require adjustment as the current 1 billion Tether issuance’s impact on a $70 billion Bitcoin market cap will have a different impact on a larger or smaller Bitcoin market cap.

Ultimately, what is worth noting is that there is a statistically significant correlation between Bitcoin price and Tether’s market cap.
