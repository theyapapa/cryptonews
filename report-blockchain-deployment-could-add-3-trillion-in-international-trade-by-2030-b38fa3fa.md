The World Trade Organization (WTO) released a report on blockchain technology’s effect on international trade today, Nov. 27.

“Blockchain and International Trade: Opportunities, Challenges, and Implications for International Trade Cooperation” analyzes blockchain applications and challenges that must be considered before the technology’s deployment in various sectors.

The study estimates that blockchain has the potential to significantly cut trade costs by increasing transparency and facilitating processes automation, including financial intermediation, exchange rate costs, coordination, and other aspects.

“The removal of barriers due to blockchain could result in more than $ 1 trillion of new trade in the next decade,” the report reads.

Conversely, the study warns about challenges that must be addressed before deploying blockchain, as well as its impact on international trade.

The report concludes:

“Blockchain could make international trade smarter, but smart trade requires smart standardization — and smart standardization can only happen through cooperation.

If we succeed in creating an ecosystem conducive to the wider development of blockchain, international trade could well look radically different in ten to 15 years.”
