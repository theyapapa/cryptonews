South Korean crypto exchange Bithumb has won a lawsuit in which an investor had sued the company for his loss of around $355,000 in an alleged hack.

According to the report, the investor — 30 year old civil servant Ahn Park — alleged he had been the victim of a hack of his Bithumb account on Nov. 30, 2017, which resulted in a loss of 400 million Korean won, or around $355,000.

He argued that Bithumb’s activities as a crypto exchange are similar in kind to services offered in the financial sector, and should thus fall subject to the security requirements that apply to electronic commerce transaction brokers.

As previously reported, Bithumb suffered a high-profile hack this June, in which around $30 million worth of eleven various cryptocurrencies were estimated to have been stolen; the exchange soon stemmed the damage with the assistance of industry counterparts, reducing the figure to $17 million.

In October, Hong Kong-based crypto exchange service Changelly revealed it had helped Bithumb to recover 1,063,500 Ripple (XRP) of the assets stolen in June, reportedly worth about $585,000 at the time of the hack.

Earlier this month, Bithumb was prompted to deny allegations of artificially inflating its trade volumes, after crypto exchange ratings and analytics service CER had accused the platform of using wash-trading to fake to 94 percent of its trade volume as of late summer 2018.

As of press time, Bithumb does not feature in CoinMarketCap (CMC)’s rankings for crypto exchanges by adjusted volume, but comes top in CMC’s separate rankings based on self-reported statistics, claiming $1,617,305,865 in traded volume over the 24 hours before press time.
