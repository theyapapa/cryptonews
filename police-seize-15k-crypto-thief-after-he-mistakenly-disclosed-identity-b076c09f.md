Connecticut police caught a man who had stolen over $15,000 worth of digital currency in a mobile phone theft after he mistakenly sent an apology email to a detective heading the investigation.

Back in April, a Connecticut resident fell victim to a cryptocurrency theft by New Jersey citizen Darren Carter, wherein the latter swiped the victimâ€™s mobile phone and allegedly transferred $15,472 worth of crypto from their Coinbase account.

Carter subsequently converted the funds to U.S. dollars that he transferred to his PayPal account, New Jersey-focused news outlet NJ.com reported on Sept. 2.

Carter decided to apologize to the victim via email, however he mistakenly sent the letter to a detective investigating the case.

The police who arrived to arrest Carter for identity theft found him already sentenced in the Salem County jail for unrelated charges.

Nguyen had hacked into the email account of a man with the same last name.

During the seven months of his scheme, $2.8 million was found to have been transferred into his bank accounts.
