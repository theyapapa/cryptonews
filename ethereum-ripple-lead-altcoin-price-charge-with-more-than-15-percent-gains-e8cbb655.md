While Ethereum’s rise was not immediately attributed to a specific factor, XRP had seemingly reacted within minutes to news that crypto exchange Binance was launching two trading pairs using the coin as a base currency.

Meanwhile, prior to ETHs price rise, Justin Sun, CEO of rival blockchain platform TRON (TRX), publicly voiced his lack of confidence in Ethereum, claiming it was “slowly imploding” along with ConsenSys, a project created by Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin that announced mass layoffs last week.

The largest cryptocurrency has managed to stay above support at $4,000 since late Saturday.
