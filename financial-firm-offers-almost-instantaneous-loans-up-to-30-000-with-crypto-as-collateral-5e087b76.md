# Financial Firm Offers ‘Almost Instantaneous’ Loans Up to $30,000 With Crypto as Collateral ...

###### 2019-02-19 08:02

A financial company is giving crypto holders the opportunity to take out cash loans while using their digital assets as collateral.

The platform offers loans from $100 to up to $30,000 — also payable in euros and Tether (USDT) — with a maximum loan-to-value of 80 percent, a ratio which YouHodler claims is one of the highest currently available in the industry.

Instead, the platform has its own fiat reserves, and says funds can be released “almost instantaneously” once loan approvals take place — a process which can take seconds thanks to the company’s automated Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) checks.

In an attempt to distinguish itself from the “unfairly biased” financial system that exists at present, YouHodler says interest rates are not going to be determined by how much collateral a borrower offers.

Repayments are made using euro and dollar bank transfers, USDT and major credit and debit cards — and once this process is complete, YouHodler says collateral is returned in full, even if it has increased in value.

Over the course of 2019, YouHodler is planning to diversify its offering further through a credit card and app, giving its customers access to their loans on a Mastercard.

## Services for miners, traders and businesses

The company says its 120-day loan term is especially popular with miners, so much so that it is referred to as the “Hodler’s Favorite.”
