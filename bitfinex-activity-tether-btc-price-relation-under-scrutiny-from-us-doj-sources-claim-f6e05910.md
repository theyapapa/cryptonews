# Bitfinex Activity, Tether-BTC Price Relation Under Scrutiny from US DoJ, Sources Claim ...

###### 2018-11-20 11:11

The U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) has focused its investigation crypto market manipulation on whether or not Tether (USDT) was used to artificially inflate Bitcoin (BTC) prices during last year’s momentous rally, Bloomberg reports Nov. 20.

Bloomberg cites three unnamed sources “familiar with the matter” who allege that the DoJ has “honed in” on the triad of Bitcoin, Tether, and its affiliated crypto exchange Bitfinex — the latter two of which share a CEO, Jan Ludovicus van der Velde.

The sources have reportedly alleged that the DoJ is looking into how Tether issues its new tokens and why the majority of Tether enter the market via Bitfinex, in the context of a broader enquiry into whether “market tricks” partially inflated crypto prices in recent years.

As previously reported, the DoJ and U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) jointly opened a criminal probe this May into Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) price manipulation by crypto traders.

Bloomberg today states it has been “unable to determine” whether the DoJ probe is solely focused on activity on Bitfinex, or whether the exchange’s executives have themselves come under scrutiny.

The DoJ’s allegedly intensified probe into activity on Bitfinex adds to prior investigations into possible misconduct; both Bitfinex and Tether received subpoenas from U.S. regulators for undisclosed reasons back in December 2017, which Bloomberg relates to insistent doubt over Tether’s claims that USDT is backed one-to-one by the U.S. dollar.

Further controversies were stoked this June when an academic paper co-authored by University of Texas professor John M. Griffin argued that “purchases with Tether are timed following market downturns and result in sizable increases in Bitcoin prices.”
