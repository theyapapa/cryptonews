Swiss-based Transoil International and Solaris Commodities have conducted a blockchain pilot transaction of Black Sea wheat, S&P Global reports Nov. 12.

Both companies are involved in the trading of international agricultural commodities like milling wheat, vegetable oil and flour.

This is reportedly the first blockchain-based trade deal of Black Sea wheat, while the exact monetary terms of the transaction have not been disclosed.

S&P Global quotes Cerealia:

"An independent auditor has reviewed all the important details of the trade from the blockchain and validated the smart contract, digital signatures, signed document and timestamps.

As Cointelegraph previously reported, the world’s four largest agriculture companies, commonly known as ABCD, partnered to digitize international grain trading by using blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies.

Blockchain and AI will be initially used to automate grain and oilseed post-trade execution processes, which are a highly manual and costly part of the supply chain.

In September, a U.S. national milk marketing cooperative — Dairy Farmers of America (DFA) — teamed up with food fintech startup ripe.io to pilot a blockchain-powered project also aimed at improving the food supply chain.
