Bitcoin (BTC) price has far higher to go during its current market cycle if crowd sentiment takes charge, according to analysis of the Bitcoin Days Destroyed (BDD) technical metric.

In social media posts Aug. 22, Hans Hauge, senior qualitative researcher at crypto investment fund Ikigai, identified Bitcoin sentiment as being similar to early 2017.

“Bitcoin bubble tops are clearly identified with a dark red cluster of Adjusted Binary BDD,” he summarized tweeting a corresponding chart.

BDD refers to the amount of time between movements of an amount of Bitcoin.

Coupled to this, as Cointelegraph recently reported, the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index, which also measures market sentiment, remains near the bottom of its possible range.

## Bitcoin accumulation phase due for timeout

BTC/USD has languished in an uninspiring sideways pattern for much of this month, leading to warnings a downturn is on the way.

PlanB, the Twitter account championing the stock-to-flow method of predicting Bitcoin price, likewise suggested current behavior mimics that of early 2017.
