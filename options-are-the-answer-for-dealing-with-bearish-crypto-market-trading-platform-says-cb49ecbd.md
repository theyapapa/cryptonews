A new blockchain asset trading platform says it is determined to help investors navigate the “bearish” cryptocurrency market – and says options could enable traders to protect and grow their assets.

According to JEX, the platform which is bringing options trading to the cryptocurrency world, this method helps investors to limit their losses while maximizing their potential profits – of course, this is not to say that there are no significant risks involved.

First, there needs to be trading pairs between a cryptocurrency and USDT – and these need to be available on large trading platforms with adequate levels of liquidity.

## Emphasis on simplicity and usability

JEX says its goal is to ensure that the products on offer are simple to understand – as this enables ordinary investors to participate on its platform.

JEX has also made trial trading accounts available to first-time investors, enabling them to experience a real-world environment and see how the decisions they make correlate into profits and losses.

Keeping trading costs low is also a stated priority for JEX, and this is why the platform has launched a dedicated token for its platform.

JEX says its staff has extensive experience in designing, developing and operating trading platforms for blockchain assets and derivatives – adding that its infrastructure provides users with a “safe, steady and reliable” service.
