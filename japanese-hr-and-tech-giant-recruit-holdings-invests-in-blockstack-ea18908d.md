Blockstack PBC CEO and co-founder Muneeb Ali reportedly remarked that United States-based startups typically partner with businesses in Japan.

According to the report, Recruit’s investment paves the way for Blockstack to expand into the Japanese market.

## Blockstack’s venture into Asia

Additionally, the report notes that Blockstack received its first funding round from Asian investors recently.

In Ali’s announcement, he made similar comments expressing his view of Asia as a central crypto player and Blockstack’s desire to expand its base in the continent, writing:

“Asia is an important market for Blockstack, as Asian countries have arguably the most significant penetration for both crypto users and developers.

\[...\] The Asian strategic round led by Hashkey and SNZ marks a new chapter, and we’re excited to expand our developer outreach and grow the Blockstack community and usage in Asia.”

## Blockstack partners with Lambda School
