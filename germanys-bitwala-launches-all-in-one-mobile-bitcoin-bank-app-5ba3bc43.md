On Aug. 29, German blockchain-based banking startup, Bitwala, announced the launch of its smartphone app for Bitcoin banking on iOS and Android.

Customers in over 30 European countries can now open a German bank account with integrated Bitcoin wallet and trading.

Bitwala CTO, Benjamin James explains:

“Once you have an account, you can seamlessly integrate your daily banking activities — whether in Bitcoin or Euro — into your everyday life.”

## Integrated Bitcoin wallet and trading

The integrated Bitcoin wallet works just like conventional online banking.

Users can buy and sell bitcoin directly from their bank account.

Bitwala CFO, Christoph Iwaniez, spoke about account security:

“With Bitwala your bitcoin are booked directly on the Blockchain via a multi-signature wallet.

This is another way of saying that hacking Bitwala is as useless as breaking the Blockchain itself and that our customers are fully in control of their Bitcoin wallets at all times.”
