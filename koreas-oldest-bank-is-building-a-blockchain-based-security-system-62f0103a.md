South Korea’s oldest bank, Shinhan Bank, partnered with two other companies to develop a blockchain-based security solution.

## Korea’s Shinhan bank to enhance security with blockchain

According to a report published on Aug. 14 by local news outlet TheKoreaTimes, Shinhan Bank signed a memorandum of understanding with financial technology startup Ground X and blockchain developer Hexlant to develop a blockchain security system.

Ground X is the blockchain unit of South Korean messaging giant Kakao, and is reportedly expected to provide a blockchain-based platform.

## User-friendly UX will help blockchain adoption says Shinhan

The first tests of the new systems are expected to take place in October.

One Shinhan Bank official commented on the development:

“Blockchain technology has gained attention from the financial sector for its advantages, but financial firms have experienced difficulties in applying the technology to their system.

\[...\] Shinhan Bank will provide a convenient user-friendly interface under the deal with Ground X and Haxlant.”

As Cointelegraph reported earlier this month, Shinhan Bank is also developing a distributed ledger technology-enabled stock lending platform after signing an agreement with financial services company Directional.
