# Crypto ‘Largely Usable Only by Developers’ Wall Street Journal Says ...

“Few tangible uses for Bitcoin (BTC) and its underlying blockchain technology have emerged,” according to a Wall Street Journal (WSJ) article published Jan. 1.

The article also states that “at the beginning of 2018, the question was whether Bitcoin could live up to the hype of 2017’s manic rally,” and at the end of 2018 the answer was “no.”

However, according to the article:

“Bitcoin and the hundreds of other digital currencies that have popped up over the years are still largely usable only by developers.”

Developing apps for the Ethereum (ETH) platform is much less intuitive than for other non-blockchain platforms, according to the WSJ.

For Ethereum, there are no developer kits which are currently available to build an app for iOS or Android, so “building a similar app for the Ethereum platform involves developing an entire suite of tools to connect the app to the platform itself.”

The article states that “despite the entry of some established Wall Street players, scammers abound.”

This idea is in line with the declarations of Jed McCaleb — Stellar’s co-founder — who recently said that “ninety percent of these projects \[that aren’t Stellar, Ethereum (ETH) or Bitcoin\] are B.S.”

The Wall Street Journal recently published research in December, according to which hundreds of crypto offerings showed signs of fraudulent activity, improbable returns, and plagiarism.
