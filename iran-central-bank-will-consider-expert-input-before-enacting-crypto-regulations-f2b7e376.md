###### 2019-01-29 11:01

Iran’s central bank said it would consider opinions from the cryptocurrency sphere prior to finalizing new draft regulations, according to a statement today, Jan. 29.

The same day, the Central Bank of Iran reportedly uploaded plans for its approach to cryptocurrency regulation on its official website.

The bank said it plans to discuss the rules at the ongoing Electronic Banking and Payment Systems Conference in Tehran, which began today.

A report from local news outlet Al Jazeera today noted that lawmakers would seek to ban aspects of cryptocurrency.

“My colleagues at the Central Bank issued a currency policy on the Bank's website, while during the two-day conference owners of the technology will be sure to have the chance to comment on this — we will wait,” a translation of the statement quotes central bank governor Abdolnaser Hemmati as saying.

As Cointelegraph reported yesterday, Iran is also reportedly set to unveil its own state-backed cryptocurrency at the conference.

According to the report, the aim of the digital currency is to skirt United States sanctions and reduce disadvantages caused by local banks being excluded from international settlement network SWIFT.
