Peer-to-peer torrent client BitTorrent has launched a native token, BitTorrent (BTT), based on the TRON protocol, according to a press release shared with Cointelegraph Jan. 3.

The token can be exchanged between users to optimize their network speed and attain faster downloads, according to the press release.

BitTorrent’s first full-fledged move to begin to tokenize its content sharing ecosystem — which reportedly serves over 100 million users — comes around six months after the company was acquired by decentralized internet startup TRON for an undisclosed amount.

BTT tokens, which are to be issued by the BitTorrent Foundation, feature native TRC-10 compatibility — meaning they adhere to a technical token standard supported by the TRON blockchain.

According to the press release, BTT is part of a broader ambition to create a decentralized content distribution platform using cryptocurrency.

The press release outlines that BTT tokens will first be implemented on BitTorrent’s Windows-based “µTorrent Classic” client — reportedly the company’s most popular application.

As previously reported, the roadmap for TRON and BitTorrent’s mutual integration has been formalized as an initiative dubbed “Project Atlas.”
