###### 2019-08-16 19:08

A United States Customs and Border Protection (CBP) advisory committee, is planning to launch a live test of its blockchain-based intellectual property rights proof of concept.

The Commercial Customs Operations Advisory Committee (COAC) will run its tests from late August to late September, per a report published on the CBP’s website.

The announcement specifically comes by way of COAC’s Next Generation Facilitation Subcommittee, an entity comprised of four working groups that aim to improve trade and government within the CBP.

According to the COAC’s most recent report, this particular proof of concept will undergo live testing starting in August:

“The working group has been active with the current POC on IPR.

Since the last in person meeting in March, the working group has progressed through the overall project design, implementation of the initial engineering plan, and integration of Trade and CBP systems.

## Prior blockchain shipment testing 

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the CBP ran a live test for a blockchain-based shipping project back in 2018.

The system itself reportedly was a combination of CBP’s legacy application and a blockchain-based platform developed by the Department of Homeland Security.
