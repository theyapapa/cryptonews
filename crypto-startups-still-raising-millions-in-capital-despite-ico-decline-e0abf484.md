# Crypto Startups Still Raising Millions in Capital Despite ICO Decline ...

Back in 2017 and 2018, such a figure might not have made many headlines, as crypto startups were raking in hundreds of millions of dollars in initial coin offerings (ICOs).

## Major ICOs of 2019

Data from ICO analytics firm ICOdata.io shows that token sales have raised more than $340 million in 2019 from 83 crypto fundraising events.

In an email to Cointelegraph, Joe DiPasquale, CEO of BitBull Capital — a crypto and blockchain hedge fund firm — commented on the factors that contributed to the decline of ICOs.

Within the current narrative of a decline in ICOs, some commentators believe that there is significant interest in the sale of cryptocurrency tokens as an investment in blockchain-based startups.

## The current cryptocurrency investment climate

With ICOs experiencing a massive decline, the narrative has shifted to other fundraising methods for cryptocurrency startups.

Despite the crypto winter of 2018 that saw prices of digital tokens plummet by more than 80% across the market, VCs continued to invest in cryptocurrency projects.

Echoing DiPasquale’s sentiments, Chugunov provided further explanation as to why VC involvement in the crypto space is still relatively insignificant, opining:

“Venture capital has not lost its interest in investing in cryptocurrencies, but the requirements for projects, in particular for products, teams, economic models and adhering to the roadmaps have grown significantly.”
