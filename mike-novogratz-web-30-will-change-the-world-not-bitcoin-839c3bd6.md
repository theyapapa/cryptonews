The world’s largest cryptocurrency, bitcoin (BTC), is not going to change the world as it is just a store of value, Galaxy Digital CEO Michael Novogratz said at ConsenSys’ Ethereal Summit on May 11.

Major bitcoin bull and former Wall Street exec Novogratz made his comments during a speech entitled “The Herd Is Still Coming!”

Starting with bitcoin, “as it came first,” Novogratz claimed that the coin has “really establishing itself as a store of value,” noting that it is “kind of finished” in terms of fulfilling its use case as a store of value.

Novogratz also compares the asset to gold, arguing that both have value as a social construct.

Since bitcoin represents a store of value or acts as a “digital gold,” it is “not going to change the world,” Novogratz argued.

Novogratz elaborated in his talk:

“If you really think bitcoin is gonna win this store of value, everything else needs to be used for something.”

Recently, Novogratz made yet another bitcoin prediction, claiming that the major cryptocurrency will beat its all-time-high record of $20,000 within the next 18 months.
