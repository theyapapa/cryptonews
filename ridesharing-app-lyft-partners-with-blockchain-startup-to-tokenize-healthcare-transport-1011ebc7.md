Ridesharing app Lyft has partnered with blockchain startup Solve.Care to tokenize healthcare-related transport arrangements.

Estonia-based Solve.Care is a decentralized, blockchain-powered platform that focuses on enhancing healthcare administration and access to healthcare services for users and insurers.

The partnership with Lyft will allow Solve.Care users to schedule Lyft rides to doctors’ clinics, hospitals, and pharmacies, with automated payments using native utility token SOLVE via their Solve.Care digital wallets.

Payment for rides can be shared with family, employers, insurers or other parties.

Solve.Care CEO Pradeep Goel said the partnership with Lyft can help the blockchain healthcare platform to:

“\[I\]mprove patient satisfaction through timely access to care, reduced wait times, and simpler cost-sharing and access to transportation subsidies.”

Blockchain technology continues to gain traction in the global healthcare sector, as hospitals, insurers, and other industry professionals continue to explore its benefits for sharing, securing and streamlining sensitive clinical and other health-related information.

Recent developments include a partnership between tech giant IBM and Canadian pharmaceutical firm Boehringer Ingelheim to use blockchain for clinical recordkeeping, as well as a project to create a blockchain network tailored to the healthcare industry from IBM and health insurance giant Aetna.
