Tim Wagner, the vice president of engineering at major cryptocurrency platform Coinbase, is reportedly leaving the company.

Wagner will purportedly leave Coinbase within the next two weeks, according to a report by CoinDesk on July 30.

At press time, Tim Wagner is currently still listed as VP Engineering at Coinbase on LinkedIn profile.

## Previous roles at Microsoft and Amazon

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Coinbase initially hired Wagner last August.

Wagner previously worked for Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft before joining Coinbase.

Andrew L. Ridenour — who worked at Coinbase for just half a year more than Wagner — left the crypto company to rejoin the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).

During his time at Coinbase, Ridenour was involved in the creation of legal structures and business plans for the platform’s trading and custodial services.
