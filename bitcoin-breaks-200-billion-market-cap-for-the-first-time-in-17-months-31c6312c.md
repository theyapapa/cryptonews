Data from Coin360 puts bitcoin firmly in the driving seat on cryptocurrency markets, 24-hour gains topping as much as 6% to take BTC/USD over $11,350.

The last time the pair traded at those levels was in the first week of March 2018, before a protracted bear market set in, which took bitcoin to lows of $3130.

In a further milestone, bitcoin’s market cap now sits at over $200 billion, a figure not seen since earlier last year.

“(Bitcoin) doesn't care about altcoin bags,” online cryptocurrency trader and investor Josh Rager commented on Twitter Monday.

Altcoins have indeed produced comparatively lackluster performance as attention focuses on bitcoin’s return to form.
