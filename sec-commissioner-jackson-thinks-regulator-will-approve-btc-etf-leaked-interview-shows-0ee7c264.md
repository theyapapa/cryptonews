A Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) will most likely ultimately gain approval from the United States securities regulator, according to a commissioner.

Robert J. Jackson Jr., the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s only Democratic commissioner, said that despite its string of rejections of ETF applications last year, the practice will ultimately change.

I hope so, yes, and I think so,” he told the publication, according to the reportedly leaked interview excerpt.

Multiple ETF proposals saw consideration by the SEC in 2018, but all of them ultimately received “no” verdicts or delays on the final outcome.

Discussing previous applications, Jackson meanwhile highlighted an effort for an ETF by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss in March 2017 as a demonstration of how attitudes were changing along with the market.

When the SEC rejected the twins’ ETF application in March that year, Bitcoin markets saw considerable volatility, a phenomenon which has since markedly decreased.

U.S. SEC commissioner Hester M. Peirce has also previously dissented from the regulator’s second disapproval of the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF in July 2018, noting that the SEC has fundamentally erred with the decision.
