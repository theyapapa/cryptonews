Cameron Winklevoss stated that “Bitcoin \[BTC\] is most likely the winner in the long term” during an Ask Me Anything (AMA) session on Reddit today, Jan. 7.

Answering a question about whether or not Bitcoin will keep its number one position among cryptocurrencies, Cameron expressed his optimistic view of the coin, saying that “Bitcoin is certainly the OG crypto!

At another point in the discussion, Cameron’s twin brother Tyler stated:

“We believe bitcoin is better at being gold than gold.

If we're right, then over time the market cap of Bitcoin will surpass the ~7trillion \[sic\] dollar market cap of gold.”

Speaking about the long-term potential of both fiat and crypto exchanges, Cameron pointed out that currently “fiat onramps are crucial crypto,” but that he “can see a future where everything (including fiat) is crypto,” plugging the twins’ USD-back stablecoin, the Gemini dollar (GUSD).

In July, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rejected the application for a Bitcoin ETF by the Winklevoss for the second time.

The brothers’ first application for a Bitcoin ETF was rejected by the SEC in March 2017.
