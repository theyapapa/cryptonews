# ICE Pushes for Bakkt Bitcoin Custody License — CFTC Approval Imminent? ...

###### 2019-05-13 04:05

The Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) is reportedly taking steps to ensure approval from the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for its bitcoin futures contracts platform — Bakkt.

## DACC acquisition and bitcoin custody plans

As reported by Cointelegraph on Monday, April 29, 2018, Bakkt’s parent company, ICE, acquired Digital Asset Custody Company (DACC) — a cryptocurrency custodial platform.

Loeffler’s comments aside, the original Bakkt application filing shows the company offering physically settled bitcoin futures contract with the physical delivery carried out via “warehousing,” as opposed to physical storage of the underlying asset.

Thus, within this bifurcated regulatory paradigm, Bakkt’s plan of warehousing bitcoin via its parent company’s clearing house runs into a few regulatory snaps, chief of which is the fact that ICE isn’t a bank.

Usually, when such a regulatory gray area emerges, an agreement could be reached to grant an exemption, allowing Bakkt to use ICE’s clearing house infrastructure for its bitcoin contract.

There is a plausible scenario in which constituent firms of the ICE clearing house might not be open to one of its members holding BTC as part of the settlement process for Bakkt’s bitcoin futures contracts.

According to reports, the major concern for the U.S. regulator was the company’s plan to settle bitcoin futures contracts via the ICE Clear US (ICUS) — a CFTC-regulated exchange and clearing house.
