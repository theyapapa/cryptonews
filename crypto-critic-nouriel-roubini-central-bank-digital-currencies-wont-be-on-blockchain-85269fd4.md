# Crypto Critic Nouriel Roubini: Central Bank Digital Currencies Won’t Be on Blockchain ...

American economist and notorious crypto critic Nouriel Roubini has argued that if and when central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are adopted, they won’t be based on blockchain.

As previously reported, CBDCs are distinct from cryptocurrencies in that they are digital currencies issued by a central bank whose legal tender status depends on government regulation or law.

During the panel, entitled the “Fundamental Value of Cryptocurrency and its Sustainability,” Roubini attempted to deflate enthusiasm about central banks’ research into the issuance of CBDCs, arguing that they won’t be issued on the blockchain or other distributed ledger technologies.

Roubini analyzed the prospective impact of CBDC adoption, noting that only banks have access to the balance sheet of central banks in the current financial system, and private individuals and corporations thus have to go via the banking system as an essential intermediary.

Rehauling this system with a CBDC, he thus argued, could bring significant transaction cost- and time- efficiency gains, with the upshot that, if adopted, CBDCs “will displace everything else \[...\] not only cryptocurrencies \[...\] but also bank deposits \[...\] and digital payment systems such as PayPal.”

Aside from his remarks on CBDCs, Roubini reiterated many of his now well-known criticisms of cryptocurrency innovation — i.e. that international governments will categorically quash any value transfer system that is truly anonymous, and that decentralization in crypto is a myth.

As Cointelegraph has reported, a new analysis from the World Economic Forum has stated that at least 40 central banks worldwide are conducting CBDC research projects and pilots with blockchain technology, which aim to address such issues as financial inclusion, payments efficiency and cybersecurity.
