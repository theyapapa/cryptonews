The United Kingdom (U.K.) Office of Communications (Ofcom) has received a £700,000 ($916,00) grant from the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) to explore blockchain technology, according to an announcement published Oct. 8.

The grant will purportedly help the U.K. telecoms regulator examine how blockchain can improve the management of landline telephone numbers.

Per the announcement, Ofcom is looking to involve industry participants to test the movement and management of “millions” of telephone numbers using blockchain technology, while the agency itself will coordinate the work.

Ofcom notes the potential of blockchain, citing regulatory and business costs reduction, more effective management of nuisance calls and fraud, and “increased industry agility” as its main benefits.

Mansoor Hanif, Ofcom Chief Technology Officer, said:

“We will be working with industry to explore how blockchain could make it quicker and easier for landline customers to switch providers while keeping their number — as well as reducing nuisance calls.

And we’ll expand our research into other areas where innovative technologies such as \[how\] blockchain could be applied to benefit consumers.”

Telephone companies in other countries have also been considering blockchain technology to manage their networks.
