## BCH/USD

After failing to sustain above the overhead resistance of $332.58, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is facing some profit booking.

If the rebound from the 20-day EMA fails to breakout of the overhead resistance zone of $332.58â€“$363.30, it will remain range bound for a few days.

## LTC/USD

Litecoin (LTC) has held the 20-day EMA for the past few days.

## EOS/USD

EOS has been consolidating above the 20-day EMA for the past few days.

The bulls have not allowed the price to dip below the 20-day EMA and the bears have not allowed a strong rebound from the support.

## ADA/USD

After failing to breakout of the downtrend line, Cardano (ADA) has broken down of the 20-day EMA.

On the other hand, if the ADA/USD pair breaks out of the downtrend line, it will again try to break out of the overhead resistance of $0.094256.
