# Swiss National Bank President Says Stablecoins Could Hamper Policy ...

Swiss National Bank (SNB) President Thomas Jordan said that stablecoins pegged to foreign currencies could hamper Switzerland’s monetary policy in some circumstances.

Jordan went on to say:

“Crypto tokens are more like speculative investment instruments than ‘good’ money in terms of their characteristics.

Given these parameters, it seems unlikely that crypto tokens will be widely used as money in Switzerland.”

Jordan further expressed his concerns in regard to stablecoins pegged to foreign currencies establishing themselves in Switzerland.

He explained:

“If stable coins pegged to foreign currencies were to establish themselves in Switzerland, the effectiveness of our monetary policy could be impaired.”

The central banker added that a Swiss franc stablecoin would have “no immediate impact on the effectiveness of our monetary policy,” but also said that giving the general public access to a central bank-issued digital currency could pose a threat to financial stability by increasing the likelihood of a bank run.
