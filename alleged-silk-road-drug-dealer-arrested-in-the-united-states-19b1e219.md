United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York Geoffrey S. Berman announced the arrest of alleged dark web drug dealer Hugh Brian Haney in a press release published on July 18.

Angel M. Melendez, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) special agent-in-charge, pointed out that — after Silk Road was closed in 2013 — cyber criminals simply sought other ways to “continue their criminal activities and more importantly launder their illicit digital currency.”

Melendez concluded:

“HSI special agents employed blockchain analytics to uncover and seize bitcoins valued at $19 million and usher Haney out of the dark web shadows to face justice in the Southern District of New York.”

The press release suggests that Haney operated on Silk Road under the pseudonym Pharmville.

The investigation allegedly exposed evidence that Haney was a high-ranking member or administrator of the Pharmville account.

In 2017 and 2018, Haney reportedly transferred his Bitcoin (BTC) proceedings to a cryptocurrency exchange.

When Haney exchanged his cryptocurrency for fiat currency and moved it into an HSI bank account, the funds were seized pursuant to a judicially authorized seizure warrant from a custodial account at a bank in the Southern District of New York.
