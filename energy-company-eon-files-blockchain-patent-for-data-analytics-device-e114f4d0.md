Energy network company E.ON has filed a patent application for a blockchain-based data collector with the European Patent Office.

As per the announcement, the device in question makes use of sensors to collect user data, which the user can then choose to sell as data analytics.

E.ON claims that the customer has sole control over who accesses any given portion of their data.

This includes E.ON itself, who cannot access customer data without explicit consent.

Regarding the role of blockchain technology in this new device — which is reportedly shaped like a small box roughly the size of a €5 bill — is to safeguard data privacy, alongside “highly secure encryption.”

Chief digital and technology officer Matthew Timms said that a solution for customers to pick and sell their data for analytics is a new innovation:

“Our Future Lab team has managed to combine blockchain and big data with a simple hardware solution.

We want our customers to have absolute control over the analysis of their data.
