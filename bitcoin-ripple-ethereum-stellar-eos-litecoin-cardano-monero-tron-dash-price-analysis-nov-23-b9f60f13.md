Though anything is possible in the markets, we believe that the oversold levels on the RSI point to a probable pullback.

Conversely, if the bulls successfully defend the $0.184 level, the XLM/USD pair, might pull back to the 20-day EMA and above it to the downtrend line.

On the other hand, if the bears sink prices below the support zone of $32â€“$29.653, the fall can extend to the next support at $20.

## ADA/USD

The pullback in Cardano could not scale the $0.05 level and the price is back at the support of $0.041.

If successful, the pullback can extend to $0.060105, which is likely to act a major resistance because this is the previous support and the 20-day EMA is also close to this level.

Any breakdown of the channel will be a negative development that can push the DASH/USD pair down to the next support at $75.

If the support of the channel holds, the bulls will attempt another pullback to scale $120 levels and reach the next overhead resistance of $129.58.
