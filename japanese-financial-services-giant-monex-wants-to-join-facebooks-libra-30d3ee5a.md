Online brokerage Monex Group Inc., owner of the hacked Japanese crypto exchange Coincheck, plans to join the Facebook Libra cryptocurrency project.

A report from Cointelegraph Japan today, July 26, reveals that Monex Group's CEO Oki Matsumoto announced the company had filed an application to join the Libra Association during a press conference on Monex's Q2 2019 financial results earlier this week.

The Libra Association is the newly-established, independent governance consortium for Facebook’s planned stablecoin, dubbed Libra, and is currently negotiating with a host of other potential members — including Visa, Uber, Mastercard and eBay.

## Entrance fees

As Cointelegraph previously reported, prospective Libra Association members must pay $10 million for the privilege.

As Cointelegraph Japan notes, should Monex Group join the Association, it would be the first Japanese company to do so.

## Better not push virtual currencies ‘underground’

Matsumoto reportedly addressed the positive potential of Libra to broaden financial inclusion in areas such as cross-border remittances and donations to emerging economies.

Earlier this month, the Banking Committee of the U.S. Senate grilled Facebook on Libra, homing in on concerns such as privacy, trust and regulatory compliance.
