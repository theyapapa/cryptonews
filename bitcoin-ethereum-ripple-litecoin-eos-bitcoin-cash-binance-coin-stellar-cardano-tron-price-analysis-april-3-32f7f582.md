# Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, EOS, Bitcoin Cash, Binance Coin, Stellar, Cardano, TRON: Price Analysis April 3 ...

###### 2019-04-03 15:04

Many theories have been put forth, one being a large order either by an individual trader or a group of traders that caused the price to break above the overhead resistance, following which the algorithms spotted the breakout and piled on long positions.

Hence, traders can book profits on about 30 percent of the long positions at the current levels and buy on dips once again.

We expect a strong resistance between $91–$100, hence, we suggest traders’ book complete profits on the remaining long positions at the current levels.

## EOS/USD

EOS scaled above the overhead resistance of $4.4930 on April 2 and is currently close to our target objective of $5.8370.

Traders can pocket 40 percent of the gains around the current levels and raise the stop loss on the remaining long positions to $210.

But if the XLM/USD pair turns down from the overhead resistance levels, it can dip to the 20-day EMA, which should provide a strong support.

The bulls again pushed prices above the resistance line today but are struggling to hold the higher levels.
