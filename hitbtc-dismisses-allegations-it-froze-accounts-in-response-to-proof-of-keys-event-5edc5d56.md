# HitBTC Dismisses Allegations It Froze Accounts in Response to Proof of Keys Event ...

Cryptocurrency exchange HitBTC has rejected allegations by some of the industry’s best-known figures that it was deliberately freezing user accounts, the company told Cointelegraph in an email Jan. 3.

Responding to a request for comment, Peter Swen, a representative from the exchange’s marketing team, denied any link between account freezes and Thursday’s ongoing Proof of Keys event.

After user complaints on social media, Proof of Keys’ organizer Trace Mayer had publicly suggested that HitBTC may be deliberately disabling withdrawals in response to the event.

Mayer’s Proof of Keys event advocates a mass withdrawing of all funds from exchanges and other centralized third parties today, Jan. 3.

HitBTC has not released a public response to the allegations, while Swen flatly refused to acknowledge any link between the withdrawal freezes and Proof of Keys, which he described as a “flashmob.”

Not on regular days, and not on special days; including events and flashmobs such as Proof of Key Day (January 3rd).”

On Twitter, exchange officials were working to counter unease expressed by users after the suspicions were aired.
