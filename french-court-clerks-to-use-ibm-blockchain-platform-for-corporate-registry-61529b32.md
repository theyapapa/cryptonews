French commercial court clerks will use a blockchain-based platform to record changes in companiesâ€™ legal status within the country.

The blockchain network was jointly developed by IBM and the National Council of Clerks (NCC) and will reportedly be deployed starting in 2019 by the clerks operating in commercial courts across France.

Vincent Fournier, Senior Manager Blockchain at IBM France, said that "blockchain's qualities are ideal for this use, improving the Clerks' business processes and adapting to the ever-changing nature of their missions."

IBM has released various commercial blockchain products and filed a number of blockchain-related patents.

Moreover, IBM reportedly offers the greatest number of blockchain jobs, according to recent research by The Next Web.

This week, IBM partnered with blockchain consortium and credit union service organization CULedger to develop new blockchain-based solutions for the credit union industry.

Also this month, IBM revealed two new patents targeting network security using blockchain technology and focusing on database management using the tech.
