# How Brexit Will Affect the UK Fintech Industry? Experts Answer ...

###### 2019-08-11 18:08

Although the U.K. gained its position back in 2015 “as the world’s leading global financial services centre,” with an ambition to become a world leader in developing fintech as well as a global hub for financial innovation, Brexit leaves a major concern within the crypto industry: How might the U.K. deal with crypto after Brexit?

However, some research has shown the negative effects that Brexit raised among financial services organizations within the U.K. For example, a report from TheCityUK underlines a significant decrease in the required tech talents in the fintech sector and a report from NewFinancial stresses that fintech businesses are moving from the U.K. to the E.U. in preparation for Brexit.

There is no consensus among experts that companies currently settled in Britain will leave the county due to Brexit, as some of them believe separating from the EU will actually attract more fintech businesses to the U.K.

## What might Brexit mean for fintech industry in the United Kingdom?

— Jane Thomason, CEO of Fintech Worldwide, industry associate of the UCL Centre for Blockchain Technologies







“It is hard to predict the precise direction fintech businesses in the U.K. will take after Brexit.

“If fintech businesses in the U.K. can’t access international individuals working in areas such as machine learning, artificial intelligence and blockchain as easily after Brexit, this could cause a contraction in the sector because currently, up to a fifth of the skills used by the fintech sector in the U.K. have come from the EU.

— Chris Stafford, doctoral researcher in the School of Politics and International Relations, University of Nottingham







“If we take No-Deal Brexit as the most likely outcome, we can expect a significant downturn for the U.K. fintech market.

Additionally, should the pound crash as a result of No-Deal Brexit, we can expect many financial actors (i.e., U.K. fintech's clientele) to simply leave the U.K. (as has already been taking place).
