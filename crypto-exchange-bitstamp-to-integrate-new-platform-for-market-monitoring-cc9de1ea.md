Founded in 2011, Bitstamp is purportedly the largest crypto exchange by trading volume in the E.U., supporting trading for Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Litecoin (LTC), U.S. dollars and euro.

The firm is a also a subsidiary of Korea-based media giant NXC Corp., which bought a 65.19 percent stake in South Korean crypto exchange Korbit last year.

In August, Bitstamp along with crypto exchanges Gemini, Bittrex, and bitFlyer USA established a self-regulatory organization dubbed the Virtual Commodity Association Working Group for digital commodities, such as cryptocurrencies.

In May, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME Group) in partnership with U.K.-based Crypto Facilities launched the CME CF Ether-Dollar Reference Rate and Real Time Index to provide users access to a real-time ETH price in U.S. dollars.

Both rates are set to be calculated by Crypto Facilities, and based on transactions and order book activity from crypto exchanges Bitstamp and Kraken.
