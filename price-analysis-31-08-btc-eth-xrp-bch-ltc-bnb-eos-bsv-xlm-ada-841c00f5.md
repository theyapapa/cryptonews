# Price Analysis 31/08: BTC, ETH, XRP, BCH, LTC, BNB, EOS, BSV, XLM, ADA ...

###### 2019-08-31 07:08

Depending on the price action during the next few days, we might suggest traders initiate long positions above $11,000 instead of waiting for a breakout above the downtrend line, as recommended in our earlier analysis.

Both moving averages are sloping down and RSI is close to oversold levels, which shows that bears have the upper hand.

Our negative view will be invalidated if the ETH/USD pair reverses direction from the current levels and quickly rallies above $192.945.

Both moving averages are trending down and RSI is close to oversold levels, which shows that bears are in command.

Conversely, if the XRP/USD pair bounces off the current levels and rises above 20-day EMA, it will indicate a likely change in the trend.

If the pair turns around from the current levels and breaks out of both moving averages, it can result in a move to $360.

However, if the price fails to break above the moving averages, we expect bears to make another attempt to sink the price to the next support of $107.
