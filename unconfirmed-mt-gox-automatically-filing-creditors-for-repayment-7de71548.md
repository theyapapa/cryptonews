# Unconfirmed: Mt. Gox Automatically Filing Creditors for Repayment ...

###### 2019-04-22 16:04

Users who held bitcoin (BTC) on the now-defunct Mt. Gox exchange and filed certain self-admission rehabilitation claims could reportedly receive some of their funds back, an unconfirmed email posted to Reddit on April 22 suggests.

Addressed to all Mt. Gox users, the message reportedly says:

“The creditors who objected to your self-approved rehabilitation claim withdrew their objections.

DerEwige interpreted the email to mean that even Mt. Gox users who failed to fill out a rehabilitation claim after losing their bitcoin have had a claim automatically made in their name, which has now been approved.

Two Mt. Gox creditors we spoke to said they have received no such message from the exchange.

According to users in the MtGoxCreditors Telegram channel, self-admission claims that were not claimed in bankruptcy or civil rehabilitation were no longer objected to if the users were able to identify themselves.

The Mt. Gox hack in 2011 was the biggest bitcoin hack the world has seen, with 850,000 BTC (worth about $460 million at the time) stolen.

In April, Mt. Gox’s trustee announced that all creditors who filed rehabilitation claims had received a decision, but warned the timing and method of repayment had not been determined.
