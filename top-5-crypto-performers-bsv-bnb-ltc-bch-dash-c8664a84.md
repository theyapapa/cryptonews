# Top 5 Crypto Performers: BSV, BNB, LTC, BCH, DASH ...

###### 2019-05-26 12:05

Bitcoin bull Michael Novogratz believes that one of the crypto assets created by the above-mentioned companies is likely to be successful and can even have a “chance to be a real currency.”

## BSV/USD

Bitcoin sv (BSV) was the best performer among the major cryptocurrencies with a rally of above 60% in the past seven days.

## BNB/USD

Binance coin (BNB) has been one of the strongest performers among the major coins: it has consistently made new highs and is in a strong uptrend.

## BCH/USD

Two miners who control about 43% of the bitcoin cash (BCH) mining pool, BTC.top and BTC.com, joined hands this week and executed a 51% attack to stop an unknown miner from taking coins that were accidentally sent to “anyone can spend” addresses.

The bulls are facing selling at the resistance line of the channel, but the positive thing is that the pair has not given up ground.

On the contrary, if the bulls fail to scale the resistance line of the channel, the digital currency can dip to the support line of the channel, closer to $300.

The DASH/USD pair has been facing resistance at $176.81 since the past week, and a breakout of this barrier will propel the pair to the next level of $229.24.
