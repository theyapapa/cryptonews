###### 2019-06-24 09:06

Major global crypto exchange Binance has listed trading pairs for USDSB, a Binance Chain-based version of StableUSD (USDS), the firm announced on June 24.

As noted in the statement, Binance has launched trading for two trading pairs, including USDSB against major stablecoin tether (USDT), as well as the USDSB-to-USDS trading pair today at 10:00 AM UTC.

Derived from StableUSD, a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the United States dollar and developed by crypto startup Stably, USDSB was issued on Binance’s BEP2 token standard in early June 2019.

According to a blog post by Stably, Binance is also rolling out USDSB trading against Binance Сoin (BNB), Binance’s native ERC-20-based token.

The firm added that they are planning to introduce more assets on Binance’s non-custodial trading platform Binance DEX “very soon in the near future.”

Following the launch, USDS trading went live on Binance on February 5.

Meanwhile, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) has today announced that the crypto exchange has carried out first margin liquidation today, June 24, claiming that it was a short of bitcoin.
