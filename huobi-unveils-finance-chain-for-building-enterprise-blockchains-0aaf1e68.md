Huobi Group is jointly developing a new public blockchain for decentralized financial (DeFi) services, according to a press release on July 1.

Major global digital asset financial service provider Huobi has partnered with Chinese blockchain startup Nervos enabling companies to deploy their own blockchains, tokenized assets, as well as DeFi services, according to the announcement.

The joint initiative, provisionally called “Huobi Finance Chain,” is targeting enterprises, financial institutions, as well as exchanges, and is set to operate as a regulatory-compliant financial blockchain network.

Specifically, Huobi is planning to enable regulators to access the network and contribute to it as validators.

Additionally, the developers expect the project to host lending services, debit services, stablecoins, security token offerings (STOs), as well as “other means of asset issuance,” decentralized exchanges (DEXs), and payment services, Huobi stated in the press release.

Founded by a former researcher and developer at the Ethereum Foundation, Nervos Network is a collection of protocols and public blockchain ecosystem.

In July 2018, Nervos raised $28 million from major industry firms including Polychain Capital in order to develop its enterprise blockchain solutions.
