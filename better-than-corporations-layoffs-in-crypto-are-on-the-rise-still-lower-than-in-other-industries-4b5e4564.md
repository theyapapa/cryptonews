Given that ConsenSys invests and helps startups building applications on the Ethereum blockchain, Lubin also made it clear that the company would become far more rigorous with projects under their care and wouldn’t hesitate to dissolve projects that may have looked promising at their inception.

## Blockchain, Bitcoin jobs on the rise

Even in this harsh slump, the outlook seems positive for the space in general.

Over the past three years, jobs relating to blockchain, Bitcoin and cryptocurrency have been on the rise on LinkedIn.

## Crypto layoffs pale in comparison

According to data from Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an outplacement company, November saw an uptick in the amount of looming job cuts in different industries in the U.S.

The company’s vice president, Andrew Challenger, believes that data collected by Challenger shows that the current economic climate is not helping matters:

“Monthly job cut announcements averaged under 35,000 in all of 2017 and just under 44,000 in 2016.

In comparison to more significant job cuts around the world, the current slump in the cryptocurrency markets and ensuring job cuts in associated companies seems relatively benign.

As an article from the Guardian back in December 2000 summed up, the year the dot-com bubble burst saw around 130 internet companies close their doors, leading to around 8,000 job cuts from internet companies.
