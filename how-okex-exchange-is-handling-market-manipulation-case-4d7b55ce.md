Last week, OKEx exchange faced negative publicity and accusations of marketing manipulation after adjusting Bitcoin Cash (BCH) futures settlements during the notorious hard fork.

## Allegations: market manipulation, silent policy updates and “sponsored” social media posts

On Nov. 14, amidst the Bitcoin Cash hard fork that resulted in two different blockchains, BCH ABC and BCH SV, being born, OKEx abruptly forced the early settlement of its Bitcoin Cash contracts “to avoid potential losses to \[their\] customers caused by the short-term volatility and possible market manipulation attempts.”

Namely, Amber AI, a Hong Kong-based crypto firm co-founded by former Morgan Stanley trader Tiantian Kullander, as per LinkedIn, published a Medium article on the matter, arguing that OKex had changed the rules of the settlement index by discontinuing to reference Bitfinex prices before the early settlement.

Thus, Qiao Changhe, the founder of Beijing-based Consensus Technologies, told Bloomberg that his fund lost $700,000 because its hedging position on OKEx “was abruptly closed at a level that didn’t reflect prevailing market prices”:

“OKEx is losing its credibility \[...\] The futures contract became something nonsense, not something we could use to hedge.”

First, the exchange claimed that they “do not have an institutional client profile named Amber AI, while Amber AI claim themselves as a Hong Kong-based company,” adding that OKEx “\[does not\] serve any customer in Hong Kong, in respect of the local laws and regulations”.

More importantly, OKEx denied any manipulation, noting that Amber AI’s statements “have caused serious damages to OKEx' reputation” and that “majority of \[OKex’\] users supports our decision of early delivery of BCH futures contracts.”

Due to the “sheer size of the order” — a hefty 4,168,515 contracts, according to the exchange — OKEx said it took preemptive action, explaining that their risk team asked the client to “partially close the positions to reduce the overall market risks” several times.
