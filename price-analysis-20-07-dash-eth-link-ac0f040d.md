On July 16, the DASH/USD pair plunged below the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of the entire rally from the lows.

On the other hand, if the bears sink the price below $95.4264, it may result in a fall to $86.3249, which is the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement of the rally.

The subsequent correction has held the uptrend line, which is close to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of $191.879.

Conversely, if bears sink the pair below $191.879, it will signal weakness and a probable drop to the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level of $144.545.

The pullback found support at the 50-day SMA, which is close to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $2.0175.

If the pair breaks out of the 20-day EMA and the downtrend line, it will signal strength and traders can buy with stops placed below the recent lows.

The next support is at the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level of $1.3202.
