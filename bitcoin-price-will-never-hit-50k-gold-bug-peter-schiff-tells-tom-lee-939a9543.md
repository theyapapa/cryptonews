Bitcoin (BTC)price will never make it to $50,000, gold bug and crypto skeptic Peter Schiff has claimed in the latest attack on the largest cryptocurrency.

## ‘This is hysterical’

In a social media debate on Aug. 20, Schiff, who is well known for his distaste for Bitcoin, said that gold would definitely reach $5,000 in the future.

Schiff was debating with Joe Kernen, the CNBC host who recently interviewed Bitcoin proponent and regular Schiff troll, Anthony Pompliano.

Joe was wrong to be bearish on gold then, and he's wrong to be bullish on Bitcoin now!”

Kernen subsequently reminded Schiff about his $5,000 gold prediction, which has yet to come true.

“My gold forecast came a lot closer than your Bitcoin forecast.

Twitter reactions pointed out the relative irony of Schiff’s bearishness, given the fact he both owns Bitcoin himself and accepts it for payments through his gold business.
