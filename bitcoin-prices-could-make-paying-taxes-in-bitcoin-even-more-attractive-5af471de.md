# Bitcoin Prices Could Make Paying Taxes in Bitcoin Even More Attractive ...

But if you owe taxes and the crypto market is up, how about paying them in bitcoin (or selling bitcoin to pay your tax in dollars)?

Ohio beat out others in the United States, such as Arizona, Georgia, Utah and New Hampshire, where efforts to accept crypto for taxes failed.

The transfer of the crypto to the tax man is a sale, and that could mean more taxes for the year of the payment.

If you bought the crypto for $10,000 the day you pay your taxes, there’s no gain.

Remember, California taxes ordinary income and capital gain at the same high tax rates.

If you actually tax in crypto, or sell crypto to pay tax in dollars, you still have taxes to pay — because of your tax payment.

But the top long-term capital gain rates are 20%, plus the possibility of the 3.8% net investment income tax under the Affordable Care Act.
