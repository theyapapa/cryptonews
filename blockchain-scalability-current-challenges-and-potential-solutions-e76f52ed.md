The main off-chain scaling solution for Bitcoin is the Lightning Network, which could offer the exponential scaling required for Bitcoin to dramatically increase its throughput.

It’s clear that the Bitcoin community will focus its efforts on the Lightning Network and other second-layer scaling solutions.

## Proof-of-work is great for Bitcoin, but we still need alternatives

Bitcoin uses proof-of-work (PoW) to form consensus in the network.

Instead of creating more PoW blockchains, we should be focusing on developing other consensus mechanisms with different trade-offs in order to support different use cases, such as voting, social media, a machine-to-machine economy and supply chain provenance.

Currently, the EOS blockchain is centralized in the hands of a few Chinese token holders, claiming to take 11 so-called “Block Producers” (the network’s term for nodes) to control the majority of EOS network, and it’s causing high-profile projects built on EOS to reconsider which blockchain they want to build on.

Also in the Bitcoin network, attackers need control of more than 50% of the network, which is a large increase from the 33% required in a pBFT system.

Barton works on the structures of various types of decentralized consensus protocols, hashing and asymmetric encryption algorithms, and analysis and applications of new blockchain and crypto technologies such as Maid Safe, Iota and NXT.
