# Study: Crypto Coverage in Media Peaked Following Market Slump ...

A recent study by blockchain-oriented research firm Clovr found that cryptocurrency coverage in the mainstream media spikes when the market drops off.

The analysis tracked the correlation between coverage on crypto values over the past five years and the sentiments of published materials.

The same trend was reported in May and June 2018, when a further drop in crypto values was followed by a temporary increase in articles.

The study further reads:

“As recently as 2016, positive articles far exceeded negative ones, both in terms of volume and intensity.

As coverage surged in mid-2017, however, articles expressing negative sentiment grew more common.

As for news sites that covered digital currency most often, Clovr notes Forbes and Business Insider, where “a combined 1,335 articles from these two outlets alone were more positive than the overall median sentiment of the sampled articles, while only 413 of their articles fell on the negative side.”

At the same time, American far-right news website Breitbart News along with left leaning American news organization Raw Story cumulatively published 91 negative articles and just one positive piece.
