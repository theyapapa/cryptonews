American investment management company Fidelity Investments is seeking talent for its digital asset wing, Fidelity Digital Assets, according to the company’s job offer listing.

Fidelity is looking for nine professionals in fields ranging from analytics and data engineering to blockchain solutions architecture and blockchain solutions engineering.

As previously reported, Fidelity — which is reportedly planning to roll out bitcoin (BTC) trading for institutional clients in the coming weeks — made an array of hirings in recent months.

Former executive of British investment bank Barclays, Chris Tyrer, joined Fidelity Digital Assets, and former Coinbase executive the head of Sales and Marketing Christine Sandler was appointed as the firm’s head of Sales and Marketing.

Fidelity Digital Assets rolled out in March of this year with a select group of clients.

As a Fidelity Investments survey revealed in the beginning of May, 22% of institutional investors already own digital assets, while 47% of respondents said that they see a place for digital assets in their investment portfolios.

The survey, however, showed that unclear regulation, volatility, limited track record, and lack of fundamentals were cited as major obstacles to investing in digital assets.
