# Crypto Seems Ready to Solve Gaming Industry’s Microtransaction Dilemma ...

For example, a market study conducted by LendEDU last year revealed that, out of a thousand gamers who were found to spend anywhere between six to 10 hours playing a game of their choice, nearly 69% of them made use of micropayments — with each individual, on average, spending $84.67 in the game.

However, over the past 10-15 years, publishers have started to use a new approach that essentially reduces the game into small parts, with the price of each supplement being charged separately through a digital transaction medium called “virtual currency.”

With that being said, micropayments have received a lot of flack from the global gaming community over the past couple of years: firstly, because they appear to serve as quick cash-grab schemes for game developers, and secondly, because they seem to take away a sense of accomplishment from the game itself.

This is because the game’s developers have devised the narrative in such a way that it is extremely difficult for nonpaying players to earn any in-game money by going through the title’s standard missions.

As online transactions have gradually become an integral part of the global gaming ecosystem, the past few years have also seen the advent of a new payment avenue for in-game purchases: virtual currencies.

— Bitrefill: As the name suggests, Bitrefill is a crypto-trading platform that allows its customers to purchase a wide array of gift cards for online gaming services — such as Steam, Xbox Live and Blizzard’s Battle.net — using Bitcoin.

— Gipsybee: This crypto marketplace allows for the purchase of a host of gaming hardware, such as wireless gamepads, video game consoles, VR headsets and much more.
