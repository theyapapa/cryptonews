Ripple has recently hired a former senior developer at Google’s new wireless messaging service as vice president of products, Reuters reports Friday, Oct. 26.

The U.S. tech company that backs the third top cryptocurrency by market cap, Ripple (XRP), has confirmed to Reuters that Amir Sarhangi is leaving his position at Google to lead Ripple’s global payments network, RippleNet.

Sarhangi reportedly joined Google in 2015 when the tech giant acquired Jibe Mobile, a startup that he founded to develop technology for wireless carriers to implement rich communication system (RCS).

According to Reuters, RCS technology has seen broad adoption by major global tech suppliers such as Apple and Samsung.

The announcement follows the recent report by Ripple that the company has seen its revenues doubled in the third quarter over Q2 in 2018.

In late September, Ripple set up a group of crypto startups in order to lobby lawmakers and financial regulators aiming to assist in taking a softer governmental stance towards crypto-related industries.

Also in October, the former COO of major U.S. stock exchange Nasdaq subsidiary Jeanine Hightower-Sellitto joined crypto exchange Gemini as their managing directors of operations to lead its client services team.
