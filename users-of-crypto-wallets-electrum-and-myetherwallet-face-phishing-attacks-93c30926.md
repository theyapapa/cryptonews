Users of cryptocurrency wallets Electrum and MyEtherWallet are currently facing phishing attacks, according to posts published on Reddit and Twitter on Feb. 4.

A phishing attack is an attempt to obtain sensitive data like users’ personal or banking information by illicit means, wherein an attacker is disguised as a trusted entity and sends a user a message or an email containing a malicious link.

On Feb. 4, the team behind MyEtherWallet tweeted a warning about a phishing email that was sent to users, asking them to divulge personal information:

Attention \#MEWfam,  
  
There's another phishy email going around asking users to give up personal information.

The latest version of Electrum (version 3.3.3) will notify users when a new release of Electrum is available.

Electrum subsequently published a warning on their website, notifying that “versions of Electrum older than 3.3.3 are vulnerable to a phishing attack, where malicious servers are able to display a message asking users to download a fake version of Electrum.”
