# ErisX’s Spot Market: More Institutional Participation and Regulatory Oversight Coming to Crypto? ...

###### 2019-05-12 04:05

United States-based cryptocurrency exchange ErisX recently announced the public launch of its spot market trading, a move that takes the company a step closer to its goal of being a one-stop shop for the trading of spot and futures contracts in a regulated environment.

Just before the end of April, there were reports that TD Ameritrade, which has some 11 million retail clients, has been testing ErisX’s crypto exchange and could soon offer crypto trading on its platform, where clients already trade traditional financial products.

Beyond crypto spot market, which is what most existing crypto exchanges offer and is also what ErisX’s spot trading is about, ErisX plans to launch a derivatives exchange once the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) approves its application to operate both a derivatives exchange and a clearing house.

These investors — which include TD Ameritrade, DRW Holdings, CBOE, TradeStation and Nasdaq, just to name a few — are interested in ErisX for a few reasons, all of which sum up to the fact that they see promise in how the crypto exchange is building a robust, transparent, integrated and regulatory-compliant market infrastructure in the crypto space.

So, the American brokerage firm invested in ErisX because it sees the crypto exchange operator as a viable avenue to offer its customers access to the crypto market in a transparent way.

Steve Quirk, executive vice president of Trading & Education at TD Ameritrade, added that:

“Our retail clients are seeking to access and trade digital currency products in the same way they do with traditional capital markets — through a legitimate, regulated and transparent exchange.

## A more transparent crypto spot market

The CFTC last year reportedly requested trading data from top exchanges, following reports that the spot market might have been manipulated for gains in the futures market.
