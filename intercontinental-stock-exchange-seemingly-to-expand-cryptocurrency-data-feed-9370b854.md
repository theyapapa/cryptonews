Intercontinental Stock Exchange (ICE), the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) hinted it was adding a slew of new coins to its Cryptocurrency Data Feed in a tweet on March 14.

Launched in January 2018, the Cryptocurrency Data Feed is a service offering real-time digital currency information, covering prices and order books.

The platform was introduced following a partnership between ICE and Bitcoin (BTC) and blockchain technology company Blockstream.

Per the recent announcement, ICE is extending the list of supported cryptocurrencies to thousands, also adding hundreds of venues.

At press time, the Cryptocurrency Data Feed supports 58 digital currencies from various data sources, markets and exchanges around the world.

The service is backed by ICEâ€™s Secure Financial Transaction Infrastructure (SFTI) tool, which claims to eliminate downtime for investors and enable immediate notifications in case of an emergency.

In February, ICE said that the launch of its cryptocurrency platform Bakkt is set for later in 2019.
