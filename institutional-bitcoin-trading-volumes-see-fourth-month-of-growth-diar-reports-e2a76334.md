# Institutional Bitcoin Trading Volumes See Fourth Month of Growth, Diar Reports ...

###### 2019-04-09 05:04

Trading of institutional Bitcoin (BTC) investment products have seen growth for the fourth month running, and are rising against United States-based crypto exchanges as a percentage of total trading volume.

Diar’s data reveals that month-on-month, the percentage that institutional BTC products account for out of total Bitcoin trading volumes has continued to steadily grow, with 15% in January 2019, 17% in February, 18% in March and now 19% in April.

Diar’s data notably focuses on three institutional products — Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Bitcoin futures, Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) Bitcoin futures and Grayscale's Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC).

Moreover, the rising relative popularity of institutional products comes amid a backdrop of declining Bitcoin trading volumes in the U.S. context overall:

As Diar notes, CBOE has logically seen the biggest decline in market dominance, having delisted Bitcoin futures in mid-March of this year as it reassesses its approach to listing crypto derivative offerings.

As a context for its findings, Diar mentions a recent analysis from cryptocurrency index fund provider Bitwise Asset Management that argued that 95 percent of volume on unregulated exchanges appears to be fake or non-economic in nature.
