On June 25, Walmart China announced plans for the movement of food products throughout its supply chain using the “Walmart China Blockchain Traceability Platform,” which was built on VeChain’s Thor blockchain.

Announced at the Traceability System Construction Seminar during the 2019 China Products Safety Publicity Week in Beijing, Walmart China indicated that “23 product lines” have been test-launched on the platform, with a further “100 product lines” spanning 10 different product categories expected to be incorporated onto the platform before the end of the year.

During the announcement, Walmart China representatives spoke of the possibility for distributed ledger technology to ensure the quality and safety of edible agricultural produce and to bolster consumer confidence through enhancing supply chain transparency, in addition to facilitating significant efficiency savings in production.

## Securities

Many analysts are predicting that security token offerings (STOs) are poised to drive a revolution in fundraising processes, owing both to the efficiency savings afforded by DLT and the advantages that the adoption of distributed ledger-based systems have in place of the complex web of centralized ledgers that currently underpin the settlement of securities.

## Real estate

During the San Francisco Blockchain Week 2019, it was announced that a security token offering had raised $18 million in venture capital to purchase a fragmented equity stake in a resort in the U.S. city of Aspen.

The offering, dubbed Aspen Coin, saw digital tokens issued via the crowdfunding website Indiegogo, allowing accredited investors to purchase Aspen Coin tokens, which are compliant with U.S. Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations.

When announcing the success of Aspen Coin, Slava Rubin, the founder of Indiegogo and president of asset management company Elevated Returns, who assisted in the execution of the offering, spoke of the potential for security tokens to expand the number of investors exposed to real estate:

“You’re actually talking about a real asset that people are paying hundreds of dollars or thousands of dollars every night to stay in, and this already makes tons of revenue.
