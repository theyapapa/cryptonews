# Paxos’ Precious Metal-Backed Cryptocurrency to Launch This Year, CEO Says ...

Blockchain trust company Paxos’ digital token backed by precious metals will be launched "definitely this year," said Paxos CEO, Chad Cascarilla in an interview with Fortune’s Balancing the Ledger on March 11.

During the interview, Cascarilla was asked whether Paxos is working on a gold-backed coin, wherein he replied that “it is something we will see definitely this year.”

In order to implement the concept, Paxos has to ensure it holds the amount of inventory “in the real world” equal to the one registered on blockchain.

Cascarilla said that the firm’s status as a financial institution allows the firm to utilize the banking system to ensure that they hold backing assets “in the real world” that correspond to the number of assets on a blockchain.

While the company is planning to launch its precious metal-backed coin this year, Cascarilla said that Paxos has not set the exact date yet.

Speaking about Paxos Standard (PAX) — the firm’s Ethereum (ETH)-based stablecoin backed 1:1 by the U.S. dollar and launched last September — Cascarilla stated that it differs from other stablecoins in that it is fully audited, highly regulated and approved by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), and relatively liquid.

Paxos holds a trust company charter in the state of New York, which gives it some of the same privileges as a bank, including the ability to take custody of mainstream financial assets.
