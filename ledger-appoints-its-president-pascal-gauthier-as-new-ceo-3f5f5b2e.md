French hardware crypto wallet producer Ledger has named its president, Pascal Gauthier, as the new chief executive officer of the company.

Gauthier — a seed investor and board member — initially joined Ledger as its president, and will now reportedly be in charge of executing the company’s strategy and delivery of its products.

The press release also notes that former CEO Eric Larchevêque will now serve as Executive Chairman of the Ledger’s Board.

Digital assets trading and custody platform Fidelity Digital Assets appointed a former Coinbase executive Christine Sandler as the head of Sales and Marketing.

In this role, Sandler will reportedly lead the expansion of Fidelity Digital Assets into new markets, as well as take responsibility for institutional customers service.

Cointelegraph also reported that former engineering executive at PayPal and Google Mike Blandina will join the team behind the institutional digital asset platform Bakkt.

Blandina will purportedly lead the firm’s efforts to combine an ecosystem for digital assets with payments use cases in order to help Bakkt bring applications to bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies.
