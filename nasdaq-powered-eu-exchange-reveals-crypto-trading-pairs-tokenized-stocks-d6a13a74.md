As Cointelegraph previously reported, users of the exchange will be able to trade tokenize stocks in various major global companies.

Another tweet on Jan. 6 announced that tokenized stocks of Amazon, Baidu, Apple, Facebook, Google, Intel, Microsoft, Netflix, Nvidia and Tesla will be available to trade on the platform.

Namely, the company revealed that Ripple (XRP) will be available to trade against Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), euro, yen, and U.S. dollars while Litecoin (LTC) will be available to trade against BTC, ETH, and USD.

Cardano (ADA) trading will also be supported on the exchange against ETH, USD, yen and BTC.

The Estonia-based platform is currently only launching in the European Union, promising to make trading available to U.S. customers in 2019, according to a tweet from DX’s co-founder and CEO yesterday.
