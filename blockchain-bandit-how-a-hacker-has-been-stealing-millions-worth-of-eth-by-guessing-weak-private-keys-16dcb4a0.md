# ‘Blockchain Bandit’: How a Hacker Has Been Stealing Millions Worth of ETH by Guessing Weak Private Keys ...

Earlier this week, United States-based security consulting firm Independent Security Evaluators (ISE) published a report on private keys for the Ethereum blockchain.

“It’s different than your banking login, where you have your username and a password \[...\] Therefore, when two individual people use the same password for creating a Brainwallet \[i.e., wallets that entail passphrases as part of generating private keys\] — like ‘password123’ — they will both own the same exact wallet.”

## The blockchain bandit

As mentioned above, during their research, the ISE team noticed how some of the wallets associated with the private keys — found with their suboptimal methods — had a lot of transactions going to a specific address, and no money was coming back out.

“It \[the blockchain\] is working as intended, it’s just the way people are using it,” he said, describing an ethics-related problem his team faced while doing their research:

“Before we started on this \[the research\], we had an ethical dilemma — what if we find the wallet with a key that has a million dollar in it?

For instance, the ISE report established that one of the most popular weak private keys is the one generated from an empty recovery phrase — i.e., “ ” — using the Parity wallet.

“For a while Parity let you use a default password of nothing and it would generate the private key based on that,” Bednarek explains, adding that the wallet developer allegedly fixed the issue at some point.

No wallet creators have contacted the ISE yet, according to Bednarek:

“That is an interesting issue because it’s hard to say which wallet was responsible, if there was a wallet at all — it could be just people entering the wrong private keys, it could be early debug versions of wallets, it could be developers themselves.
