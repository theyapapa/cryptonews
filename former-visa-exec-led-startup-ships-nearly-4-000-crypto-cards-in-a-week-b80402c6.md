Crypterium, crypto payment firm led by former Visa exec, has shipped about 4,000 crypto debit cards in a week since the launch of the card, according to a press release on June 27.

Crypterium, an Estonia-headquartered fintech company, launched its Crypterium Card on June 12, offering global community a prepaid card loaded with major cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), litecoin (LTC), USD Coin (USDC), as well as Crypterium’s own CRPT token.

As the company wrote in the announcement, the new bitcoin card operates “in the same way as a traditional prepaid card,” enabling online and in-store crypto purchases on a number of services including Amazon, Netflix, as well as tuition fees, or medical bills, among others.

Crypterium has managed to deliver 3,736 Crypterium Cards to around 70 countries in the first week after the launch of the solution, citing “booming demand” amid the current BTC price surge and nascent bull market.

Steven Parker, former General Manager of global payment giant Visa, said that these impressive numbers reflect the actual global demand for a “stable debit card” that provides equal status to crypto and traditional currencies in terms of payments.

On June 11, U.S.-based crypto exchange and wallet service Coinbase launched its Visa debit card in six European countries, enabling customers to sync their cards directly to their Coinbase accounts and withdraw fiat currencies from ATMs.

Earlier this week, Cointelegraph reported that the total number of global bitcoin ATMs (BTMs) has reached 5,000.
