# South Africa Is Making Strides Toward Crypto Clarity With the Reserve Bank’s Latest Report ...

###### 2019-01-22 12:01

A working group of South African financial regulatory organizations has released a consultation paper focused on cryptocurrencies, calling for public input to develop a cryptocurrency regulation policy for the country.

This latest consultation paper is the most in-depth review of cryptocurrencies from South African financial institutions since an initial public statement on what it calls crypto assets was issued by South African authorities back in 2014.

Over the next few years, the cryptocurrency industry grew exponentially, and the surge of interest led to the establishment of an Intergovernmental Fintech Working Group (IFWG), which began developing a review for regulators and policymakers focused on fintech, taking into account the implications for the financial sector and economy of South Africa.

Most importantly, the IFWG has called upon the South African public to give feedback on the paper and engage on the way forward, while making it clear that there was no intent to ban the use of cryptocurrency in the country.

## Risks

The paper analyses the perceived risks that cryptocurrencies could have on the South African economy.

According to Marius Reitz, Luno’s South Africa country manager, the daily volumes have exceeded 1,200 BTC per day on its South African exchange in recent months:

“These numbers demonstrate the growing adoption of cryptocurrencies in South Africa and across the globe and reinforces our aim of upgrading the world to a better financial system.”

He suggests that the move is a balanced approach that protects conventional financial institutions and consumers while not impeding on the use of cryptocurrencies:

“Having carefully read through SARB’s consulting paper on regulating crypto assets in South Africa, it’s clear to me that they want to be as progressive as possible without hindering and infringing on the security of South Africa's central banks.
