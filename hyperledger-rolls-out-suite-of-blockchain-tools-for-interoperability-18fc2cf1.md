Hyperledger has introduced a set of tools dubbed “Hyperledger Aries” aimed at interoperability of different types of blockchain-based data.

Hyperledger Aries is a set of tools that purportedly enables the exchange of blockchain-based data, supports peer-to-peer (P2P) messaging and facilitates interactions between different blockchains and other distributed ledger technologies.

Per the post, Hyperledger rolled out the project in order to provide code for P2P interaction and advance interoperability, among other objectives.

The product includes a blockchain interface layer, cryptographic wallet, encrypted messaging system, application programming interface-like use cases and other tools.

In February, Intel, which is a member of the Hyperledger collaboration, launched a commercial blockchain package based on the Hyperledger ecosystem designed for businesses that want to launch their own blockchains.

Last December, the Hyperledger Technical Steering Committee approved the Ursa project, a modular cryptography software library.

That same month, Hyperledger onboarded 12 new members, including Alibaba Cloud, a subsidiary of the eponymous e-commerce giant; financial services firm Citigroup, Deutsche Telekom, one of the largest telecoms providers in Europe; and European blockchain trading platform we.trade, among others.
