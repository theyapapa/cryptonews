# Cryptocurrency ‘Illegal’ In India Says Trade Organization Head ...

###### 2018-10-25 23:10

The head of an Indian nonprofit trade organization said cryptocurrency is “illegal,” and urged businesses to obey the law, local news daily the Hindu reported Thursday, Oct. 25.

Debjani Ghosh, the president of the National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM), was cited by the Hindu saying that cryptocurrencies are illegal from NASSCOM’s perspective.

“It is \[the\] law of the land and hence, we have to work with it,” Ghosh claimed about cryptocurrency’s ‘illegal’ status.

However, Ghosh noted that the “illegal” status of crypto is the result of the government’s failure to keep up with innovation:

“The genesis of this problem, however, lies in the failure of policy making not keeping pace with rapid technological changes.

Cryptocurrency is currently legal in India, but in July the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) banned the country’s banks from servicing businesses involved in exchanging or processing digital assets.

Following the crackdown, commentators were quick to note that, while banking activities for crypto business were suspended, it was not a ban on crypto in India outright.

According to a police official quoted by the Times of India, the central bank considers cryptocurrency “illegal.”
