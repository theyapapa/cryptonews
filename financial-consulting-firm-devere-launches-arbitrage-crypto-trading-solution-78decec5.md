# Financial Consulting Firm DeVere Launches Arbitrage Crypto Trading Solution ...

###### 2018-11-02 07:11

Major independent financial consulting company deVere Group has launched a suite of new Digital Asset Funds targeting “experienced investors,” according to a deVere press release published Nov. 1.

DeVere founder and CEO Nigel Green has said the company’s move into crypto funds management was given impetus by the recognition that “\[c\]ryptocurrencies are now undeniably part of mainstream finance.”

DeVere’s new digital asset solution is designed to address burgeoning demand from clients who want exposure to the crypto sector, with “portfolio diversification” and “decent returns,” yet with “reduced volatility.”

The solution will reportedly invest in a diversified portfolio of crypto assets, using algorithmic trading across platforms — including crypto exchanges and over-the-counter (OTC) markets — to maximize arbitrage opportunities.

The press release proposes that arbitrage — when the price of a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH) is discrepant between platforms — can be algorithmically optimized, and claims that the deVere solution allows investors to generate profits from cross-platform trades “with little or no directional market risk.”

Dalma Capital CEO Zachary Cefaratti has said that the crypto markets “abound with durable inefficiencies,” which provide an opportunity for “hedge funds to generate uncorrelated excess returns through systematic relative value arbitrage, momentum trading and mean-reversion strategies.”

DeVere has been closely watching the emerging crypto space, with Nigel Green interpreting the low levels of volatility in the markets of late as a “signal that the cryptocurrency market is maturing.”
