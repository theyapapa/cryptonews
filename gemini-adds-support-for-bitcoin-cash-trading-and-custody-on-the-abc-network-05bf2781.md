Cryptocurrency exchange Gemini announced support for Bitcoin Cash (BCH) custody and trading today with a post on its official Medium blog, Dec. 8.

The exchange pointed out that, at the moment, it will “only be providing support for the Bitcoin ABC network” which is identified on the platform as “Bitcoin Cash with ticker: BCH.”

Gemini declared that they “are continuing to evaluate Bitcoin SV over the coming weeks or months, and we may or may not choose to support withdrawals and/or trading of Bitcoin SV in the future.”

In order to ensure legal compliance, the company, which claims to be the world’s most regulated cryptocurrency exchange and custodian, reportedly “worked closely with the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYSDFS) to obtain approval to offer Bitcoin Cash trading and custody services.”

Bitcoin SV and Bitcoin ABC are the two blockchains that contended for the Bitcoin Cash name after a controversial hard fork.

What was often referred to as a “war” in the crypto community ended when Bitcoin SV backer and billionaire entrepreneur Calvin Ayre declared that the chain no longer wants the Bitcoin Cash name, as Cointelegraph reported Nov. 24.

In October, Gemini gained regulatory approval to offer trading of major cryptocurrency Litecoin (LTC).
