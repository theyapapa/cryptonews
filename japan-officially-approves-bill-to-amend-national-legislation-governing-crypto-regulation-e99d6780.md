# Japan Officially Approves Bill to Amend National Legislation Governing Crypto Regulation ...

The Japanese House of Representatives has officially approved a new bill to amend national laws that govern crypto regulation, Cointelegraph Japan reported on May 31.

The bill seeks to introduce amendments to two national laws that apply to crypto assets — the Act on Fund Settlement and the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act.

Now that the bill has been passed, the revised Acts are expected to come into force in April 2020, Cointelegraph Japan reports.

The proposed amendments to Japan’s financial instruments and payment services laws will ostensibly tighten cryptocurrency regulation in a bid to promote user protection, more robustly regulate crypto derivatives trading, mitigate industry risks such as exchange hacks and broadly establish a more transparent regulatory framework for the new asset class.

As previously reported, the bill also establishes a legal name change for cryptocurrencies as “crypto assets,” formerly designated in the country as “virtual currencies.”

Cointelegraph Japan today notes that while there is reportedly a view within the industry that regulation has thereby been tightened, some consider that Japan's virtual currency regulation will set a global benchmark for regulating the sector.

Earlier this month, Cointelegraph reported that Russia was postponing the adoption of crypto regulation due to a requirement from the Financial Action Task Force that it expand the terminology of a federal bill to legislate major industry terms such as cryptocurrencies and bitcoin (BTC).
