# QuadrigaCX Would Never Have Lost Crypto Keys Had It Been in Bermuda, Says Premier ...

The Premier of Bermuda, David Burt, has argued that a QuadrigaCX-like situation could not have happened in Bermuda because of the country’s existing legislation in regard to cryptocurrencies.

Burt delivered his comments following QuadrigaCX’ founder, Gerald Cotten’s sudden death last December, and financial difficulty the exchange subsequently faced.

Burt stated in the interview that QuadrigaCX’s private keys could never have been lost if the exchange were registered in Bermuda, and not Canada.

Burt said:

“If Quadriga was licensed under the Bermuda Monetary Authority, what has happened would not have been able to happen, because we have rules regarding the custody of master keys and making sure they’re not held by a particular individual.”

Burt apparently discussed the country’s Digital Asset Business Act 2018, the new regulatory regime that sets visible boundaries for blockchain and cryptocurrency-related businesses and protects the rights of their existing and potential clients:

“It basically states what you have to do with the master keys, how those things have to be handled, and making sure that they cannot be lost, or if they are lost, there’s a way for that recovery to happen.”

Last year, the country’s government announced plans to make amendments to the Banking Act in order to establish a new class of bank to render services to local fintech and blockchain organizations.

Burt said then that individual bank policies not to provide banking services to the new type of companies "cannot be allowed to frustrate the delivery on our promise of economic growth and success for Bermudians."
