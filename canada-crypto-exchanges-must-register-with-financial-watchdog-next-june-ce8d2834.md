# Canada: Crypto Exchanges Must Register With Financial Watchdog Next June ...

###### 2019-07-10 21:07

Cryptocurrency exchanges in Canada will be legally required to register with the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FinTRAC) as of June 1, 2020, according to a notice published on July 10.

Crypto exchanges will also reportedly be required to observe Know Your Customer policies and report any suspicious transactions to the Canadian watchdog; this also includes keeping records of their clients and hiring a compliance officer for their platform.

The motivation for implementing the new policies is reportedly to get Canadian banks onboard and in cooperation with cryptocurrency exchanges.

According to Lori Stein, a partner at business law firm Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt, Canadian financial institutions have historically been concerned about the risk of money laundering and terrorist financing via crypto exchanges.

However, Stein points out that some international exchanges may not be willing to comply with the new Canadian rules.

Some other experts reportedly agree, saying that having mandatory regulation requirements could result in cryptocurrency exchanges opting to exit from the Canadian marketplace.

“This has the potential to drive cryptocurrency underground again," said Canadian crypto exchange Coinsquare’s AML officer, Charlene Cieslik.
