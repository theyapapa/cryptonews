The Swiss data protection regulator is waiting for Facebook to provide it with particulars on data protection risks associated with the forthcoming Libra digital currency, Reuters reported on July 23.

The Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) — the competent authority for data processing by federal bodies and individuals in Switzerland — sent a letter to Libra Association on July 17, asking for details about Libra.

The FDPIC stated:

“The Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner has noted the remarks made by Mr. David Marcus at his hearing before a U.S. Senate committee.

The news follows a statement from the head of communication at the FDPIC, Hugo Wyler, who said that Facebook had not contacted Swiss regulators regarding the registration of its cryptocurrency project.

As previously reported, Marcus assured Representative Bill Huizenga that Facebook had been in touch with the Financial Market Supervisory Authority, a Swiss financial regulator.

Marcus also underlined that Facebook would not launch the Libra cryptocurrency project before they received the go-ahead from all relevant regulatory authorities.

At a hearing with the United States House of Representatives Financial Services Committee on July 17, Rep. Patrick McHenry asked Marcus why Facebook wanted to have its project based in Switzerland.
