# New SFOX Report: Don’t Call Ethereum an ‘Altcoin’ Anymore ...

## ETH is more correlated to BTC than other alts

In its post, SFOX suggested that “it may no longer be accurate to classify Ethereum as an ‘altcoin.

’” The reason why the exchange is suggesting that ETH may not fit into the altcoin category is that BTC’s current correlation with Ether is markedly higher than its correlations with other altcoins.

The author of the post also notes:

“This may support the idea that Ethereum is coming into its own as a blockchain that is publicly recognized as an asset on its own terms, much like Bitcoin.

If this trend continues, it may become inappropriate to categorize Ethereum as an ‘altcoin’ on a par with other cryptoassets that are not Bitcoin.”

The reported correlations to Bitcoin of other altcoins, on the other hand, are: Bitcoin Cash (BCH) 0.638, Litecoin (LTC) 0.577, Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) 0.619, Ethereum Classic (ETC) 0.602.

## Libra controversy increased BTC’s volatility

The post also points out that the recent controversy around Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency seemingly increased Bitcoin’s volatility and dominance — while decreasing the price — in the crypto market despite the cryptocurrency not being directly under scrutiny.

The author of the post further points out that Bitcoin’s dominance in the cryptocurrency market increased from roughly 50% in March to between 65% and 75%, 64.5% at press time according to CoinMarketCap data.
