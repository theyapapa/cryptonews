San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange OKCoin will now offer fiat-to-token and token-to-token trading services to residents of seven more US states.

## OKCoin expands services in the United States of America

On Sept. 5, OKCoin, one of the top cryptocurrency exchanges by adjusted volume, announced that its trading services are now available in 7 new US states: Arkansas, Iowa, Kentucky, Mississippi, Pennsylvania, Utah and Wisconsin, which are added to an already extensive list of areas of operation in the US.

## Expanding into Europe

Cointelegraph reported in early June that OKCoin had decided to launch its services to non-United States customers, who from that moment were able to deposit and withdraw euros, as well as participate in euro spot trading for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Bitcoin Cash (BCH).

Apart from expanding its trading services in Europe, OKCoin opened an office in Malta.

## Donation up to 1,000 BTC to developers of BTC, BCH, and BSV

As Cointelegraph reported yesterday, OKCoin pledged to dedicate up to 1,000 BTC to the development of Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV (BSV).

The initiative, called ‘Let’s Build Bitcoin Together,’ is asking crypto enthusiasts to go to the OKCoin platform and cast their vote for the project they would like to receive a donation.
