The Gibraltar Blockchain Exchange (GBX) has secured a license from the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission (GFSC), according to a company blog post Nov. 22.

The GBX was established in July of this year by the Gibraltar Stock Exchange (GSX).

“As from 21st November 2018, the GBX will operate as a fully licenced provider of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), regulated by the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission under Gibraltar’s Financial Services Regulations 2018 DLT framework,” the announcement reads.

Currently the GBX supports trading in six digital assets, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and the exchange’s native Rock (RKT) token, with plans to add more fiat currency onboarding options, in addition to USD, “in the near future.”

Gibraltar is known for its push to develop a blockchain and cryptocurrency-friendly environment.

One of the principal aspects of Gibraltar’s ICO regulations is said to be the introduction of the concept of “authorized sponsors,” who are supposed to be “responsible for assuring compliance with disclosure and financial crime rules.”

By March – ahead of the planned launch of the GBX – Gibraltar had attracted “200” prospective ICOs, which reflected “huge” interest in launching token sales under the territory’s newly regulated ICO environment.
