The $145 million in digital assets that are reportedly stuck in encrypted cold wallet storage of QuadrigaCX crypto exchange could actually be missing, according to analysts cited by the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) on Feb. 6.

In December 2018, the founder of major Canadian cryptocurrency exchange QuadrigaCX, Gerald Cotten, passed suddenly.

Cotten was reportedly the sole executive with access to the exchange’s cold wallets.

A filing from Ernst & Young states, “Quadriga was unable to access the cold wallets and/or discovered that the cold wallets contained minimal cryptocurrency units.”

James Edwards, a a cryptocurrency analyst who publishes research on a Zerononcense, reportedly reviewed the publically available transactions of the exchange, and found no evidence that the exchange controlled any of the wallets it claimed to.

“It appears that there are no identifiable cold wallet reserves for QuadrigaCX,” he purportedly wrote in a report.

Powell even suggested that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police contact his exchange as it has “thousands of wallet addresses known to belong to \[QuadrigaCX\]” that Kraken is investigating.
