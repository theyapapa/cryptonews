A subsidiary of Japanese e-commerce giant Rakuten, Rakuten Wallet, has partnered with blockchain security firm CipherTrace to assure Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance for the company’s upcoming crypto exchange.

CipherTrace — which develops cryptocurrency AML, forensics and regulatory monitoring solutions — will work on improving the safety of Rakuten Wallet’s investors as well as the protection of the integrity and compliance of the exchange.

Rakuten Wallet cares about its customers and will work with CipherTrace to make sure that exchanges have optimal protections for mainstream adoption.

Rakuten Wallet plans to launch the exchange in June.

Opening an account will reportedly be free of charge and customers’ funds will be stored in a cold wallet — a device for storing digital currency that is not connected to the internet.

Rakuten Wallet had already opened its online account registration process for cryptocurrency trading services in mid-April, requiring traders to register with a Rakuten user ID and associated bank account.

Also in April, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters that Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) will require cryptocurrency exchanges to strengthen their internal supervision of cold wallets.
