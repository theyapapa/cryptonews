The head of the Finance Committee of France’s National Assembly, Eric Woerth, is suggesting a ban on anonymous cryptocurrencies, or so-called privacy coins.

In a forward to the report, Woerth considers the introduction of a ban on digital currencies that provide greater anonymity to users, stating:

“It would also have been appropriate to propose a ban on the dissemination and trade in \[cryptocurrencies built\] to ensure complete anonymity by preventing any identification procedure by design.

\[...\] This is the case for a certain number of \[cryptocurrencies\] (Monero, PIVX, DeepOnion, Zcash...) whose purpose is to bypass any possibility of identifying the holders.

Apart from that, Woerth addresses possible problems associated with cryptocurrencies, including fraud, tax evasion, money laundering, and energy consumption.

“The distinction between the different uses of \[cryptocurrencies\] must continue, to establish a finer and more precise regulation protector of the general interest, as well as the private interest of the entrepreneurs of this domain,” the president purportedly added.

In April of last year, Japanese regulators suggested similar measures by preventing cryptocurrency exchanges from trading anonymity-oriented altcoins Dash (DASH) and Monero.

“It should be seriously discussed as to whether any registered cryptocurrency exchange should be allowed to use such currencies,” said an unnamed member of the country’s regulator the Financial Services Authority.
