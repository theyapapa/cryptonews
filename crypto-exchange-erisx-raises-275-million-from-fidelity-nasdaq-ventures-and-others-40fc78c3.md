Crypto exchange ErisX has raised $27.5 million from Fidelity Investments and Nasdaq Ventures, among other investors, Reuters reports Dec. 4

Nasdaq is the world’s second largest stock exchange, while U.S. investment firm Fidelity administers over $7.2 trillion in client assets.

According to Reuters, ErisX will offer both on spot trading in Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Litecoin (LTC), as well as futures markets in the following year, pending regulatory approval.

Nasdaq confirmed their participation to Reuters without specifying the amount of their contribution, while Fidelity has not responded to Reuters’ requests for comments by press time.

According to Thomas Chippas, ErisX CEO, the investment’s purpose is to hire staff and “build out our infrastructure and secure the appropriate steps are taken to develop a regulated market for digital assets.”

In October of this year, retail brokerage firm TD Ameritrade had also invested in ErisX, with participation from investing company DRW Holdings and high-speed trader Virtu Financial.

Reuters writes that the private equity firm Valor Equity Partners and CBOE Global Markets Inc also participated in the fall investment.

Bloomberg had noted this fall that ErisX would also offer Bitcoin Cash (BCH) support, but the altcoin was not mentioned by Reuters in today’s article.
