A United States federal court has ordered two executives from crypto firm AriseBank to pay nearly $2.7 million in fines, according to a U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) announcement Dec. 12.

AriseBank CEO Jared Rice was arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on Nov. 28 on charges of defrauding hundreds of investors of over $4 million.

Moreover, Rice allegedly spent investors’ funds for his personal ends, while posting AriseBank’s “nonexistent” benefits both in printed press releases and online.

This month, the SEC issued a cease and desist order against CoinAlpha Advisors LLC — which managed CoinAlpha Falcon LP fund — in addition to ordering a $50,000 penalty.

The fund had allegedly raised over $600,000 from 22 investors, which purchased limited partnership interests in the fund in exchange for a proportional share of any profits derived from the fund’s investment in digital assets.

In November, the Securities Commissioner of the U.S. State of Texas issued an emergency cease and desist order against crypto investment firm My Crypto Mine and its principal Mark Steven Royer.

Also in November, the SEC chairman Jay Clayton reiterated his wary view of crypto markets.
