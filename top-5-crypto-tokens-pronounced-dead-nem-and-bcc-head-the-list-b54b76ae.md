Bitcoin still dominates the portfolios of most crypto investors and is by far the most popular cryptocurrency, meaning its price is less prone to drops than the rest of the market.This is also indicated by the CoinMarketCap dominance chart.

Many “dead” crypto projects were scams organized as ICOs and some could not stand the pressure of the bearish market in late 2018.

However, only by the end of 2017 did cryptocurrency investors decide to publicly accuse the project of organizing an investment scam — a so-called Ponzi scheme.

One of the more prominent critics of the project was billionaire and well-known Bitcoin investor Mike Novogratz, who stated on Twitter that BitConnect really looks like a Ponzi scheme that hurts the image of the entire industry: “BitConnect really seems like a scam.

Texas and North Carolina regulators forced the founders to close the lending program and their cryptocurrency exchange, making the BitConnect (BCC) token redundant and subsequently causing it to depreciate.

## Universa

The Russian-based project Universa attracted $28 million during its token sale in December 2017.

Major players in the crypto market have voiced their concerns regarding the project — with Ledger, for example, stating that Bitcoin Diamond was involved in fraudulent schemes at the end of 2017:

“SCAM WARNING — multiple sites claim to let you collect Bitcoin Diamond.
