# Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, EOS, Stellar, Litecoin, Cardano, Monero, TRON: Price Analysis, October 15 ...

###### 2018-10-15 17:10

If the bulls close (UTC time frame) above $6,850 levels, it will be a positive sign and will invalidate the bearish descending triangle pattern.

A breakout and close (UTC time frame) above $250 can attract buying, pushing prices to the next resistance zone of $300â€“$322.57.

## BCH/USD

Bitcoin Cash held the support line of the symmetrical triangle for the past four days and launched itself higher today, reaching close to the resistance line, where sellers emerged.

A breakout and close (UTC time frame) above the symmetrical triangle will signal a change in trend that can result in a rally to $660 and $880.

## XLM/USD

The rally in Stellar broke out of the overhead resistance of $0.24987525 and the downtrend line of the descending triangle.

If the XLM/USD pair closes (UTC time frame) above this level, it will invalidate the bearish pattern, which is a bullish sign.

The traders can expect an up move to the $0.0415 level if the price closes (UTC time frame) above $0.02815521.
