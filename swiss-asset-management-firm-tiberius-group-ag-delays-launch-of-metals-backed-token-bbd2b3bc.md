Switzerland-based commodities assets manager Tiberius Group AG has delayed the sale of its metals-backed cryptocurrency, Tiberius Coin, due to high fees from credit card companies, Bloomberg reported Oct. 9.

Now, the Swiss firm will reportedly delay the launch of Tiberius Coin due to “unacceptably” high fees from credit card processing companies.

Per Tiberius’ assessment, it will be unable to handle orders worth $15 million due to “restrictions” put on credit cards.

Tiberius stated:

“As of now, we are investing heavily in our platform, improving it and working with notable credit card processors to onboard new payment gateways for our client base to use.

Credit card companies have previously shown some hesitation about working with cryptocurrency companies and digital asset trading.

In June, San-Francisco-based bank Wells Fargo announced that it will no longer allow its customers to purchase cryptocurrency using its credit cards.

In February, Cointelegraph reported that customers at J.P. Morgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup can no longer purchase cryptocurrencies with credit cards.
