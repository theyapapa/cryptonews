Amazon Web Services, Inc., an Amazon.com company, announced that the Amazon quantum ledger database (QLDB) was now available.

## Transparent and immutable transaction log

According to a post on Sept. 10 from Amazon Web Services (AWS), the newly available Amazon QLBD is a new class of database that provides a transparent, immutable and cryptographically verifiable transaction log ‎owned by a central trusted authority.

The post continues to explain that Amazon QLBD eliminates the need to engage in the complex development effort of building one’s own ledger-like applications or rely on the capabilities of a blockchain framework.

Shawn Bice, a VP at Amazon Web Services, Inc. told Business Wire that AWS has been using a version of Amazon QLDB for many years to store data for some of its most critical systems, and has benefitted from being able to view an immutable history of changes.

He added:

“Today, we are proud to announce Amazon QLDB, offering customers a fully managed service that provides the same ledger capabilities, along with the ability to cryptographically verify data integrity.

## Amazon hires blockchain experts

At the beginning of August Cointelegraph reported that Amazon was looking to hire a software development engineer for its Colorado team to develop an advertisement blockchain.

The post read:

“Our new team in Boulder, CO is looking for a Sr Software Engineer to work within our Advertising FinTech team focused on a Blockchain ledger, billing and reconciliation systems to provide data transparency on transnational financial data.”
