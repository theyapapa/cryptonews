Overstock’s venture capital subsidiary Medici Ventures has invested in decentralized social network Minds, Inc. (Minds.com), according to a press release shared with Cointelegraph Oct. 22.

Per the release, Minds has received Series A investment from Medici Ventures, although the investment sum was not revealed.

With the investment, Overstock.com founder and CEO Patrick M. Byrne has reportedly become a member of Mind’s board of directors.

Moreover, Minds has adopted the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) Manila Principles as the platform’s Digital Bill of Rights in order to “ensure freedom of speech” for its users.

Earlier this month, the company through its subsidiary Medici Ventures invested in Israeli-based technology company VinX to develop a token-based digital wine futures platform based on the Bordeaux futures model.

Prior to that, Overstock’s blockchain land registry subsidiary Medici Land Governance (MLG) signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Zambia.

Byrne, who is known as an early advocate for Bitcoin (BTC) and blockchain technology, sold 10 percent of his shares — a $20 million sum — in September.
