The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA), an organization that aims to establish standards in the blockchain sector, has published a collection of use cases for blockchain in telecommunications.

## Blockchain solutions for telecoms

The EEA shared the announcement with Cointelegraph on Aug. 28.

According to the announcement, the new document on blockchain solutions in the telecom industry was created by the EEA Telecom Special Interest Group (SIG).

## Use cases and contributors

Additionally, the document contains a number of detailed use cases for blockchain solutions in telecoms, including the following: Blockchain-Based Telecom Call Roaming User Authentication; Blockchain-Based Telecom Call Roaming Reconciliation; and Data Privacy and Monetization, among others.

EEA Telecom SIG member Dr. Andreas Freund of ConsenSys remarked:

“These telecom use cases allow the EEA to identify the building blocks, automated contracts, and standards needed to drive the next generation of Ethereum-based telecom applications \[...\] Our goal is to educate EEA members along with global telecom professionals to the uses and benefits of EEA standards and Enterprise Ethereum blockchain technologies while fostering industry cooperation and interaction.”

A number of major telecom groups helped to create this document, and EEA Executive Director Ron Resnick commented on some of these notable contributors.

## Prior work by the EEA

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the EEA published a document on blockchain use cases in the real estate sector in May.
