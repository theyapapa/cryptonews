# Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, EOS, Stellar, Litecoin, Cardano, Monero, TRON: Price Analysis, Nov. 14 ...

###### 2018-11-14 16:11

## BTC/USD

Bitcoin crumbled today as the break below the trendline attracted sharp selling, plunging prices to new year-to-date lows.

On the other hand, if the current pullback attempt is met with another round of selling, then traders can expect the fall to extend to the next lower supports of $136 and $110.

If this level breaks, the next support is much lower at $0.24508.

## EOS/USD

EOS plummeted below the tight range and fell to the critical support at $4.4930.

Today, the price sliced through the critical support zone at $49.466â€“$47.246 and fell to a low of $42.758.

## TRX/USD

TRON broke below the bottom of the range and fell close to the critical support at $0.0183.

However, if the $0.0183 level breaks down on a closing (UTC time frame) basis, the TRX/USD pair might slump to the next lower level at $0.00844479.
