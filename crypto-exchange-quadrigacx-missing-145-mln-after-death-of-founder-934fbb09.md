Following the sudden death of its founder Gerry Cotten, cryptocurrency exchange QuadrigaCX is reportedly missing CA$190 million dollars ($145 million) in digital assets, Canadian news daily The Globe and Mail reports on Feb. 1

Citing a creditor protection filing from the Nova Scotia Supreme court, the Globe and Mail states that the firm has been unable to locate or access the funds since Cotten passed on Dec. 9, leading to a liquidity crisis at the exchange.

The exchange kept most its assets in offline storage systems called cold wallets, which are secured by digital security keys in order to protect them from hacking and theft.

Cotten was solely responsible for the wallets and corresponding keys, which the company has been trying to find after his passing.

A filing from Ernst & Young reportedly states, “Quadriga was unable to access the cold wallets and/or discovered that the cold wallets contained minimal cryptocurrency units.”

Cotten’s wife, Jennifer Robertson, reportedly stated in an affidavit, “I do not know the password or recovery key.

Other exchange operators told The Globe and Mail that it was unusual for a single executive to control access to an exchange’s funds, as it would have made Cotten a target for kidnapping and extortion.

Users of the platform, some of whom were already unable to withdraw funds due to a legal battle between the exchange and a major Canadian bank, took to Twitter and Reddit following an announcement of Cotten’s passing.
