Major tech firm IBM has partnered with MineHub Technologies to deliver a blockchain solution that will improve supply chain management in the mining and metals industry.

MineHub is a company that uses technologies including blockchain to develop cost-saving applications for the metals and mining industry.

The newly announced mining supply chain platform will be built on the cloud-based IBM Blockchain Platform powered by the Linux Foundation's Hyperledger Fabric.

The companies envision the digitization of the supply chain via the creation of a ledger shared between the parties that will provide an aggregated, real-time view of transactions and data flowing through the supply chain, and will only be open to permissioned participants.

The development of the platform will also be supported by such companies as gold producer Goldcorp Inc., ING Bank, mineral exploration company Kutcho Copper Corp., trading firm Ocean Partners USA Inc., and precious metals streaming company Wheaton Precious Metals Corp., representing a consortium formed by MineHub.

Earlier today, Cointelegraph reported that IBM will use its IBM Blockchain Platform to monitor supplies of cobalt from the Democratic Republic of Congo in collaboration with motor company Ford, South Korean cathode producer LG Chem and Chinaâ€™s Huayou Cobalt.

In September, Hong Kong-based jewelry retailer Chow Tai Fook has reportedly put records of some of its diamonds on a distributed leger developed by blockchain startup Everledger and secured by the IBM Blockchain Platform.
