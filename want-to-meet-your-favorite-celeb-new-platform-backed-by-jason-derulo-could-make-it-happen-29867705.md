A platform enabling celebrities to “cryptonize” their popularity on an exchange powered by blockchain, while giving fans the opportunity to connect and engage with their idols in new ways, has attracted the support of several prominent stars.

Several renowned names from the sporting world joined the platform prior to Derulo, including Filipino boxer turned politician Manny Pacquiao and former Liverpool striker Michael Owen, who were among the first to sign up to GCOX, making headlines internationally.

While newer public figures have the chance to increase their profile, catalyze their popularity and build a brand, established celebrities will be able to mobilise existing fans and sustain their momentum. ”

According to GCOX, the services it offers to celebrities and their fans can be split into three specialised platforms.

Fans would also be able to be their own merchants and conduct their own transactions for their favorite celebrities’ memorabilia on the platform.

Here, celebrities have the chance to engage with their fanbase like never before, whether this involves sending birthday video greetings on social media or sharing a live-stream with fans using the respective celebrity’s tokens in exchange for such services.

GCOX’s chief executive officer, Dr Jeffrey Lin, told Forbes India he was driven to develop the platform so fans would no longer have to fantasize about interacting with the celebrities they’ve come to admire.
