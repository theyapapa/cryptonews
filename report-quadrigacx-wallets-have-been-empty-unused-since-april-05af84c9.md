# Report: QuadrigaCX Wallets Have Been Empty, Unused Since April ...

###### 2019-03-01 20:03

Big Four audit firm Ernst & Young (EY) released its “Third Report of the Monitor” in the creditor protection proceedings of Canadian crypto exchange QuadrigaCX on March 1.

Within the report, the audit firm has identified six separate crypto wallets that were used primarily to store Bitcoin (BTC), the cryptocurrency most used on the platform.

Furthermore the report states:

“To date, the Applicants have been unable to identify a reason why Quadriga may have stopped using the Identified Bitcoin Cold Wallets for deposits in April 2018, however, the Monitor and Management will continue to review the Quadriga database to obtain further information.”

In early February, the exchange filed for creditor protection when — after the death of its founder Gerald Cotten — it lost access to the cold wallets and corresponding keys, that ostensibly held the assets owed to various clients.

Today’s report also states that, within the course of its investigation, EY has discovered 14 user accounts that “may have been created outside the normal process by Quadriga” and that “\[i\]t appears that the Identified Accounts were created under various aliases.”

The report continues:

“...the Identified Accounts were internally created without a corresponding customer and used to trade on the Quadriga platform.

\[EY\] was further advised that deposits into certain of the Identified Accounts may have been artificially created and subsequently used for trading on the Quadriga platform.”
