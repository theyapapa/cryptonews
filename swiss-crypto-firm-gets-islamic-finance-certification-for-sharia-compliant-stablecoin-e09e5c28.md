Switzerland-based fintech firm X8 AG has received a certification from the Shariyah Review Bureau (SRB) for its Ethereum-based stablecoin, Reuters U.K. reports Nov. 12.

Reuters notes that some Islamic scholars have deemed crypto trading to be analogous with the “transfer of rights,” which is legitimate under Sharia law.

According to X8 director and co-founder, Francesca Greco, X8’s ETH-based crypto asset is a “stablecoin,” whose backing by a basket of seven fiat currencies and gold is considered to assuage Islamic advisors’ concerns over excessive volatility and speculation.

As reported this July, altcoin Stellar (XLM) received a Sharia compliance certification in the money transfer and asset tokenization field, claiming to be the first blockchain protocol to have done so.

Other crypto companies claiming “firsts” in the sector include crypto utility token NOORCOIN, which was certified with a Sharia Certificate from the World Sharia Advisory Committee in March.

Bitcoin (BTC) was was recognized as “generally permissible” under Sharia law this April by an internal Sharia advisor to fintech startup Blossom Finance.

Sharia advisor Muhammad Abu Bakar included a warning that while he considers digital currencies to be halal (permissible), in most cases traders should not purchase them for investment purposes.
