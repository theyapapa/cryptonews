# Cryptocurrency Regulation Necessary to Keep Firms in US, Says Circle CEO ...

The CEO of cryptocurrency trading and investment firm Circle thinks the United States will create appropriate regulation as more companies move overseas.

Allaire’s comments come in the aftermath of his testimony at Tuesday’s dedicated crypto and blockchain policy hearing, the latest in a series of sessions U.S. lawmakers have held on the emerging industry.

As Cointelegraph reported, the recent hearings have produced a wide range of reactions from lawmakers, from acknowledgment of Bitcoin (BTC) to claims it funds global terrorism.

On Tuesday, Senate Banking Committee chairman Michael Crapo became the latest official voice to suggest that it would be impossible for the government to ban decentralized cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.

“If the United States were to decide that we didn’t want cryptocurrency to happen in the United States and tried to ban it, I’m pretty confident we couldn’t succeed,” he said.

Allaire meanwhile added that global appetite for cryptocurrency would take the form of crypto-style technology being implemented on top of existing fiat currencies first.

“I think we’ll see support from governments for central bank money that operates on top of these digital currency systems,” he predicted.
