# Meet the 21-Year-Old Entrepreneur Trying to Sell His Failed ICO on Ebay ...

Enter Ivan Komar, the 21-year-old owner of a startup called “Sponsy,” who is trying to sell his project on eBay for $60,000 after failing to gain the interest of the public in his tokens.

## “There was one person who bought some tokens for $10, so it can’t be counted as an ICO”: Sponsy’s brief history of failure

Komar started his project at the end of 2017, as he told Cointelegraph over Skype.

The reason why they were so late, the young entrepreneur said, was his lawyer, who advised him to develop the actual product before launching an ICO — a decision Komar now seems to regret:

“We would not have tried to build a product first, we would have tried to run a token sale as soon as possible, to jump into this crypto craze bandwagon and raise as much money as possible before building any product.

## Non-existent sponsors and unattended events

There are other inconsistencies with Komar’s project.

Those people receive compensation for their efforts in the form of SPONS tokens, Komar clarified, adding:

“But they are not going to make any real cash out of it, because we are selling our project.

Finally, Sponsy is described as a blockchain project that could launch both ICO and a security token offering (STO).

Komar told Cointelegraph that his startup had received all the documents required for holding a token sale from the same lawyer who advised him not to run an ICO before having developed any actual product.
