The world's second-largest stock exchange, Nasdaq, is allegedly testing trading of a bitcoin (BTC)-based product, according to a tweet by an analyst at quantitative trading analytics service StrongMarket on April 22.

Twitter personality Cryptopolis, a quantitative analyst at StrongMarket, tweeted that he bought one bitcoin through an account on retail brokerage firm TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ: AMTD) on Monday.

Cryptopolis suggested that bitcoin was trading on the platform against United States dollar under the unknown symbol “CXERX,” which is purportedly listed on the Nasdaq.

While the analyst concluded that it was not a real trade on his account, he still alleged that Nasdaq is quietly testing a new bitcoin-based asset that is available only through their Paper Trading platform.

In late 2018, Nasdaq reportedly confirmed its plans to launch bitcoin futures in the first half of 2019.

In February 2019, Nasdaq started listing two cryptocurrency price indices from United States blockchain and crypto market data company Brave New Coin (BNC), including BNC’s Bitcoin Liquid Index (BLX) and Ethereum Liquid Index (ELX).
