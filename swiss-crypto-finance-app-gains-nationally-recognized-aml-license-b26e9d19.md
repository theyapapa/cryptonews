Cryptocurrency-focused personal finance app Aximetria has gained a financial standards license recognized by Swiss regulators.

In a press release provided to Cointelegraph July 29, Aximetria, which is based in the country, said the Swiss Financial Services Standards Association (VQF) license would allow it to function as a crypto intermediary and streamline its onboarding process.

The VQF license is approved by Switzerland’s overarching finance regulator, the Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).

“The Swiss license is of vital importance to Aximetria and our customers, partners, investors and the industry at large, including the blockchain ecosystem,” Alexey Ermakov, founder and CEO of Aximetria, commented in the press release.

He continued:

“Compared to the EMI (Electronic Money Institution) license, which is the most popular regulation standard for European and British companies, the Swiss license is much more desirable for a fintech company.

As Cointelegraph reported, Switzerland has continued its pro-crypto regulatory stance in the wake of the annual conference of the Crypto Valley Association, its dedicated lobbying group composed of multiple industry businesses.

A positive outcome will be seen as especially pertinent given the state of cryptocurrency regulation in major markets this year, particularly in the United States, where lawmakers continue to debate the industry’s future, often voicing polarized views.
