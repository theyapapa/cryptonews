lt will take “weeks, if not months” to repair the “technical damage” caused by the recent collapse of Bitcoin (BTC), according to a Fundstrat Global Advisors analyst, Bloomberg reports today, Nov. 15.

In a note to clients yesterday, cited by Bloomberg, Fundstrat’s Rob Sluymer predicted that Bitcoin’s collapse yesterday has pushed crypto markets into a “deeply oversold” area, while “longer-term technical indicators aren’t so favorable.”

Sluymer concluded that Bitcoin will be able to support a “multi-month rally,” but only after the “significant” damage done this week has been overcome:

“This week’s breakdown produced significant technical damage that will likely take weeks, if not months, to repair to create a durable enough price ‘structure’ to support a multi-month rally.”

Yesterday, the largest cryptocurrency Bitcoin dipped below the $5,600 price point for the first time since October 2017, breaking longstanding recent support around $6,000 and hitting multi-month records of volatility.

Both Monex Group, owner of crypto exchange Coincheck, and SBI Holdings suffered a slump of more than 2 percent to close at two-week lows in Tokyo, Bloomberg reported.

Impact of Bitcoin’s slump on Asia Crypto Stocks.

Earlier in summer, Fundstrat’s head of research Tom Lee reiterated his prediction that Bitcoin will trade between $22,000 to $25,000 by the year’s end.
