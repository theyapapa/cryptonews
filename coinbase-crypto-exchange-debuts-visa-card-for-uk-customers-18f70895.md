Major American cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has launched Coinbase Card, that enables its United Kingdom-based customers to pay in-store and online with cryptocurrency.

The Coinbase Card is a Visa debit card powered by customers’ Coinbase account crypto balances, which allows them to make purchases with digital currencies worldwide.

Coinbase instantly converts customers' cryptocurrency funds into fiat currency in order to complete the purchase.

Coinbase also released the Coinbase Card app for iOS and Android, which links customers’ Coinbase accounts with the app and allows them to choose a particular wallet to fund their Coinbase Card.

The card reportedly supports all digital assets available to purchase and sell on the Coinbase platform.

Currently, Coinbase Card is available for customers in the U.K., however Coinbase reportedly plans to add support for other European countries in the near term.

Earlier this month, Visa itself published a crypto and blockchain-related job opening.
