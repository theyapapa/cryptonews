# Blockchain Tech and the Energy Industry: More Decentralization and Greater Efficiency ...

## Microgrids

The most exciting use of blockchain in the energy industry — and the one that fits best with the whole ethos of decentralization — comes in the context of microgrids.

Even before Bitcoin and blockchain, such grids have been distributed by definition, comprising smaller sources of energy generation (e.g., wind turbines, solar farms) that link together in localized networks in order to provide electricity that isn't dependent on centralized power plants and utility companies.

In particular, this is the aim being pursued by the Energy Web Foundation (EWF), an international nonprofit organization that, according to its director of marketing, Peter Bronski, is bringing blockchain tech to all areas of the energy industry.

"EWF is actually building a core blockchain — similar to but importantly distinct from Ethereum — specifically tailored to the energy sector and the industry's unique regulatory, operational, and market needs: the Energy Web Chain," he tells Cointelegraph.

And as Stefan Jessenberger at Siemens Digital Grid explains to Cointelegraph, blockchain won’t simply enable greater security and efficiency, but also the possibility for changing how energy companies and producers operate:

"In our view, the blockchain technology might revolutionize the way DERs \[distributed energy resources\], grid operators and marketplaces will interact in a secure, efficient and transparent way while also enabling new business models.

## Trading energy

Aside from offering a secure record of transactions and also rewards for producers, blockchain tech is set to serve the energy industry in other ways.

## Challenges

But as promising as blockchain tech seems for the energy industry, there are, as ever, a number of challenges that have to be overcome before distributed ledgers become an integral part of the sector.
