It offers participants a share in an ambitious reforestation project in Paraguay, where fast-growing eucalyptus trees will be planted in vacant areas 20 percent bigger than the entire city of Paris — and that’s just the start.

One TREE token is equal to one tree planted at the start of the project and will be worth $23, with all land purchases and management overhead included, the company explains.

TreeCoin promises that 50 percent of the profit made by selling the timber will be reinvested to buy more land to plant more trees, and 10 percent will be donated to charities to support projects related to “nature, water treatment, hospitals, child care centers, foundations, and associations for people with handicap and disadvantages.”

The current project’s scope is 22 years, and during that period, the TreeCoin team will seek to amass some 597 square kilometres under its management, becoming one of the largest landowners in Paraguay.

According to the company, every TREE security token issued will trigger the emission of 100 TreeCoins, the accompanying payment tokens of the project.

The team says the project has the backing of the Paraguayan government to implant TreeCoins as a legal tender into the local economy of the area where the project will operate.

TreeCoin is freely tradeable, so TREE token holders will be able to sell their TreeCoins to the local economy’s actors when the project takes root, the company highlights.
