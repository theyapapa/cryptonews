# What Is a Satoshi, the Smallest Unit on the Bitcoin Blockchains ...

From paying for pizza with satoshi (SAT) on the Lightning Network to the 10,000 satoshis being added to the Lightning Torch each time it is passed, down to the 1 sat/byte rate on the bitcoin SV network, SAT is being used more and more in blockchain and crypto conversations.

The satoshi is the smallest unit that is recorded on the bitcoin blockchains: One satoshi represents a decimal, seven zeros and a 1, followed by any of the bitcoin tickers — i.e., bitcoin (BTC), bitcoin SV (BSV) or bitcoin cash (BCH).

It all began on Nov. 15, 2010, when BitcoinTalk user Ribuck proposed that 1/100 of a bitcoin (0.01 BTC) — the smallest unit that could be displayed on the interface, at the time — be called a satoshi.

This time, when Ribuck joined the discussion, he got feedback — eight days later, in an entirely new thread titled Bitcent, in which BitcoinTalk user Kolbas decided it was time to think about smaller monetary units recorded on bitcoin’s blockchain.

On the Bitcent thread, a user commented reinstating Ribuck’s initial proposal, the user said:

“1 satoshi = 1 microbitcent (smallest denomination)

100 million satoshis = 1 bitcoin

Are we agreed?”

But because of bitcoin’s relatively high price compared to the price of many day-to-day goods and services, when items are priced in BTC, they usually end up with relatively unattractive numbers — for example, $5 is 0.00057206 BTC, at the time of writing.

Both price and price bias seem to contribute to the time lag regarding SAT gaining popularity, but all in all, the industry appears to have made SAT a meme in and of itself, finding their own unique ways to incorporate satoshi into our lives — like the lightning torch — and doing so in such a way that these events that it is involved in have caught fire and gone viral in their own respects, bringing satoshi along for the ride with it.
