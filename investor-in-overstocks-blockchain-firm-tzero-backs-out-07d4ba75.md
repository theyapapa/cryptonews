# Investor in Overstock’s Blockchain Firm TZERO Backs Out ...

###### 2019-08-26 13:08

Singaporean private equity firm Makara Capital said it will not invest in Overstock’s blockchain subsidiary tZERO.

In an Overstock investor call on Aug. 26, Overstock’s interim CEO Jonathan Johnson said that Makara recently informed the firm that they “will be not investing in tZERO right now.”

## Medici Ventures will continue to support tZERO

Johnson emphasized that Makara remains excited about tZERO’s product and will potentially reconsider its investment decision as tZERO progresses.

Byrne developed a crypto-friendly strategy at the company, including the launch of tZERO itself and Overstock’s acceptance of Bitcoin (BTC) payments.

## One year of investing plans

Makara’s retreat from investment in tZERO does not appear to be surprising as the company delayed the investment several times since the fundraising was initially announced in August 2018.

In August 2018, Overstock announced that Makara would invest $404 million in tZERO along with Chinese investment firm GSR Capital.

On May 9, tZERO finally secured a $5 million investment from Chinese investment firm GSR Capital, while both GSR and Makara were reported to be still considering additional investment.
