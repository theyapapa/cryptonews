Thai cryptocurrency exchange Satang Corp. plans to raise nearly $10 million in a security token offering (STO), despite the recent market meltdown, Asia-focused business publication Nikkei Asian Review reported Dec. 4.

Satang’s plans are reportedly supported by the Government of Thailand in a bid to make the country a blockchain center and develop a regulatory framework for digital currencies and blockchain.

Just last week, the deputy secretary of the Thai Securities and Exchanges Commission Tipsuda Thavaramara declared that Thai-related STOs launched in an international market break the law.

In November, Insom reportedly helped deploy blockchain technology during a primary election in the country’s Democrat Party.

"I hope that other political parties or even the government not just in Thailand but in the region can look to using blockchain technology in enabling large scale e-voting or polling," Poramin reportedly said.

Thailand’s Revenue Department is reportedly testing blockchain technology for tracking value-added tax (VAT) payments.

According to Ekniti Nitithanprapas, director general of the Thai Revenue Department, the department “wants to use blockchain technology to prevent VAT refund fraud.”
