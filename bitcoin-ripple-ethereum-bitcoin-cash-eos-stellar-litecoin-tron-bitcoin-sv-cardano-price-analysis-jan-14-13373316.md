# Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, EOS, Stellar, Litecoin, Tron, Bitcoin SV, Cardano: Price Analysis, Jan. 14 ...

While the Winklevossâ€™ view can be considered biased, as they have a vested interest in crypto prices going up, the arrival of established players into the asset class shows the promise it holds.

If the bulls sustain above the 20-day EMA, the ETH/USD pair might consolidate between $116.3 and $167.32 for a few days.

The bulls have been unable to push the price back into the range, which indicates a lack of buyers at the current levels.

Our negative view will be invalidated if the BCH/USD pair sustains above the moving averages.

Though the price quickly reclaimed the moving average, the bulls are facing selling at higher levels.

## BSV/USD

Although the bears broke below the support of the range on Jan. 10, they could not push the price toward the next support of $65.031.

However, if the price turns down from the 20-day EMA and breaks below the 50-day SMA, it can decline to the strong support of $0.036815.
