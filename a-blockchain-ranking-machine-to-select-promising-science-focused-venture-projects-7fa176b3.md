## Nerds to the rescue

The company has developed an algorithm for a bias-free, decentralized evaluation of projects so that investors can fund venture projects in science and other areas including initial coin offerings (ICOs) with more confidence.

In other words, the bunch behind this nerdy name, have come up with nothing less than a project ranking machine, coupled with an algorithm that can distinguish an informed and knowledgeable opinion from the rest.

## It is a coin, and it is scientific

ScientificCoin’s Chief Executive Officer Maxim Dvedenidov says its ranking algorithm is based on the same mathematical principles that venture funds, insurance companies, and stock exchanges use to evaluate investment candidates.

The program models the rating of the project by the correlation of its characteristics, and then a ranking in with allocation of a rating for each characteristic of a project.

The company’s leader elaborated:

“The algorithm we have created will not allow \[experts\] to take the project appraisal frivolously.

The influence of an expert’s vote on the rating of a particular project will depend on a lot of factors, including the expert’s evaluation history, their personal details, and the level of uniqueness of the project”.

Does the same fate expect project ranking algorithms like ScientificCoin?
