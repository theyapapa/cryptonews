# Bloomberg: Key Indicators Show Bitcoin Price Could be Losing Steam ...

###### 2019-03-12 21:03

Key price movement indicators show that Bitcoin (BTC) could be heading for another move downward, according to a recent report from Bloomberg on March 12.

Bloomberg notes that the seminal crypto’s Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator has been moving downward since mid-February.

The MACD is a trend-following indicator of momentum that shows the relationship between two moving averages of the price of a security.

Bloomberg states that, until Bitcoin can break through that level, it is likely to face selling pressure.

Bloomberg analyst Mike McGlone said:

“The entire industry is ripe to resume a path to lower prices.

Other industry experts have suggested that investors are forgoing Bitcoin to move their money into altcoins.
