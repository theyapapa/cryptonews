Saturday, Oct. 20: Crypto markets are seeing little momentum, with virtually all of the major cryptocurrencies seeing slight growth and losses between a 1-2 percent range, as Coin360 data shows.

Following its short-lived ascent to $6,965 Oct. 17, correlated with Tether’s price tumble, Bitcoin has corrected back to a trading range just a little higher than at the start of its weekly chart.

On the week, the top coin has seen a gentle increase of around 3.3 percent: on its monthly chart, growth is just 0.23 percent.

Over the past week, the leading altcoin has seen a similar trading pattern to Bitcoin, spiking to $220 Oct. 15 before correcting downwards and then sideways in recent days.

The strongest top-ten performer is fourth largest coin Bitcoin Cash (BCH), up 1.4 percent on the day to trade around $447.

In the context of the top twenty coins, the market picture is also stable, with virtually all assets seeing minor growth of below the 1-2 percent mark.

A new report from Big Four auditor Ernst and Young has found that among the “top” initial coin offerings (ICOs) that raised capital in 2017, 86 percent of project tokens are trading below their listing price, with 30 percent having lost “substantially all value.”
