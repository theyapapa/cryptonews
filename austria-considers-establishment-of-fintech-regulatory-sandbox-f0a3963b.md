The Ministry of Finance in Austria is considering establishing a regulatory sandbox for the fintech industry, Cointelegraph auf Deutsch reports on April 26.

State Secretary Hubert Fuchs said:

“For some companies in the fintech industry, it is particularly difficult to keep track of all regulatory requirements and developments right from the start.

In the regulatory sandbox, fintech companies will purportedly be able to test and train their business models for a limited period under the supervision of the FMA.

The announcement refers to the concept of a regulatory sandbox developed by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the United Kingdom, and reveals that an expert from the FCA was therefore also involved in the development of the Austrian sandbox.

To become a participant of the sandbox, companies will have to fulfill certain requirements, such as the development of a business model based on information, communication, or blockchain technology, among others.

In the future, fintechs will be able to test their innovative business models in a sandbox.”

In February, Bahrain’s central bank revealed plans to launch a regulatory sandbox to allow blockchain and crypto companies to work in the country, pending formalized regulations.
