# Malta's Prime Minister Tells UN That Crypto Is the 'Inevitable Future of Money' ...

The Prime Minister of Malta, Joseph Muscat, has said that cryptocurrencies are the “inevitable future of money,” and that blockchain can galvanize a more transparent and equitable society.

Muscat made a spirited case for the transformative, political impact of bleeding-edge technologies, saying that those who “pair the new digital economy with a new state – a digital state,” will be best poised “to create a future-proof society”:

“Blockchain makes cryptocurrencies the inevitable future of money, more transparent since it helps filter good businesses from bad businesses.

The Prime Minister argued that distributed ledger technologies (DLT) – of which blockchain is one type – will transform the gamut of political, civic, and corporate systems.

Their potential to solve “decades-old problems” was the impetus for Malta to “launch itself as a ‘Blockchain Island,’” he said, claiming the island was “the first jurisdiction worldwide to regulate \[the\] technology,” prising it out of a “legal vacuum.”

Malta’s Prime Minister proposed that DLT can ensure “that no one is deprived of their legitimate property because of compromised data,” that corporations “become more accountable to their shareholders,” and that states “move from hoarding information on their citizens to regulating an environment where citizens trust the handling of their own data.”

The Prime Minister nonetheless recognized the resistance that such new technologies may encounter, noting that:

“There are challenges in this fast and obvious transition to a digital economy and society.

In June, the Maltese parliament approved three DLT- and crypto-related bills, consolidating the island’s bid to remain at the forefront of blockchain innovation.
