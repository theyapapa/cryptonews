Former United States Representative Harold J. Ford has argued that Congress should have a nuanced approach to regulating cryptocurrencies.

He noted a comment from Chris Larsen, the executive chairman and co-founder of blockchain startup Ripple, who asked Congress, “Please do not paint us with a broad brush,” when referring to the crypto industry.

## Separate crypto from Libra

Ford specifically addressed the issue of social media giant Facebook and its not-yet-released Libra stablecoin.

Ford urged lawmakers to separate the cryptocurrency industry in general from the Facebook matter.

According to the former Democratic congressman, the lack of regulatory clarity is already causing harm to innovation in the U.S., further noting that some other countries such as Belarus, Malta, Bahrain, and Gibraltar are already working on regulatory frameworks that are attractive to crypto and blockchain projects.

Ford stated:

“The U.S. should not be losing the competitive edge on attracting this innovation’s best and brightest.

Earlier in September, the Financial Integrity Network (FIN) — a Washington D.C.-based advisory firm — urged Congress to regulate firms in the cryptocurrency sector under the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA).
