# SIM Swapping Becomes Increasingly Popular in California, Police Make It “High Priority” ...

SIM swapping is the process of making a telecom provider like, say, T-Mobile, transfer the victim’s phone number to a SIM card held by the attacker — usually bought off of eBay and plugged into a “burner” phone, as Samy Tarazi, a sergeant at the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s office and a REACT supervisor, told KrebsOnSecurity:

“We’re talking about kids aged mainly between 19 and 22 being able to steal millions of dollars in cryptocurrencies \[...\] we’re now dealing with someone who buys a 99 cent SIM card off eBay, plugs it into a cheap burner phone, makes a call and steals millions of dollars.

Once the hackers get access to the victim’s phone number, they use it to reset his or her passwords and break into their accounts, including email and accounts on cryptocurrency exchanges.

Mobile store employees trick unsuspecting associates at other branches into swapping a victim’s existing SIM card with a new one.

REACT Lieutenant John Rose explains that it is much easier and safer for SIM swappers to steal crypto funds alone, even if they discover passwords for traditional bank accounts during the hack:

“Many SIM swap victims are understandably very scared at how much of their personal information has been exposed when these attacks occur.

For instance, in early July 2018, Christian Ferri, CEO of San Francisco-based cryptocurrency firm BlockStar was hacked and reportedly lost $100,000 worth of cryptocurrencies as a result of SIM swap, according to KrebsOnSecurity.

Ferri was on a trip in Europe when he found out that his T-Mobile phone no longer had service — the hackers had allegedly broken into T-Mobile’s customer database and deactivated the SIM card in his phone.

Fletcher Robert Childers, 23, and Joseph Harris, 21, were accused of stealing $14 million from a San Jose-headquartered cryptocurrency company Crowd Machine via SIM swaps.
