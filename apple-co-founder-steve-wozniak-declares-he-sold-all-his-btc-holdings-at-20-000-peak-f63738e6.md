Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak has said that he sold all of his Bitcoin (BTC) when the currency hit $20,000 in December 2017.

Financial media outlet Business Insider Nordic reported on Wozniak’s comments on Jan. 24.

Speaking at the Nordic Business Forum in Stockholm, Sweden, Wozniak said that he first bought an undisclosed quantity of Bitcoin when the crypto was at about $700 because he “wanted to experiment with it.”

Still, when Bitcoin reached its all-time high of about $20,000, Wozniak reportedly sold all of his BTC holdings.

Wozniak concluded that he has “never been into money in any way” before disclosing “I've never used Apple's stock app, I don't buy and sell stock.”

Furthermore, as Cointelegraph reported in June last year, Wozniak said that “only Bitcoin is pure digital gold” in an interview, reaffirming his belief in the cryptocurrency despite having already sold most of his holdings at the time.

Even when he described blockchain as a bubble resembling that of the dotcom era during the same month, Wozniak still pointed out that Bitcoin is “just amazing.”
