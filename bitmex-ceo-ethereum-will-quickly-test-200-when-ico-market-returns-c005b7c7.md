Initial coin offerings (ICO) will return within “18 months” and Ethereum (ETH) will “rebound aggressively,” BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes told Cointelegraph Japan Dec. 26.

Speaking in an exclusive interview, Hayes forecast a return to form for 2018’s “dead” ICO markets.

When the ICO market returns, Ether will quickly test $200.

The timing of the ICO rebirth is 12 to 18 months out.”

Hayes made the comments following a now rare day of stability across cryptocurrency markets, with ETH/USD staying range bound within 1 percent of $129 after doubling in a week.

In the coming 12-18 months, however, Hayes first predicts stablecoins will have their time in the limelight before an ICO resurgence.

He did not elaborate on whether that market will implode like that of the 2017 ICO boom.
