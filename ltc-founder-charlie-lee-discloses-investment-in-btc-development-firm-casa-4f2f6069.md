On Aug. 16, Litecoin (LTC) founder Charlie Lee disclosed in a tweet that he is “an investor in Casa,” a Bitcoin (BTC) personal key security firm.

He also noted that he has high hopes for the company:

“I have the same feeling about Casa today as I had about Coinbase when I joined in 2013 as the 3rd hire.

Casa is making Bitcoin easy to use and that is extremely important for this space.

## A notable hire

The tweet was posted in response to Casa announcing the hire of a former engineer and product developer at Microsoft and software firm Tableau, as well as a Seattle Bitcoin Meetup organizer Brian Lockhart.

The tweet states:

“We are thrilled that we were finally able to convince him to come out of retirement and play in the big leagues at Casa.”

According to Crunchbase, Casa received $2.1 million in funding so far during its seed round in March 2018.

As Cointelegraph reported in June, Casa Node, one of the industry’s popular pre-synced node products, relied on an inbuilt Raspberry Pi, though earlier iteration of the model caused frustration for some users due to its reported slowness.
