Germany’s second largest stock exchange, Boerse Stuttgart Group, has officially launched its crypto-trading app Bison, according to an official tweet today, Jan. 31.

Another subsidiary of the stock exchange, Blocknox, will act as custodian for users’ funds, using an escrow system, according to a press release published on Finextra today.

However, the stock exchange giant clarified that it plans to eventually extend trading to 24 hours a day.

Bison was first announced by the stock exchange in May, 2018.

For instance, the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) is planning to set up a regulated digital asset exchange.

Hong Kong is also set to launch a digital assets exchange in Q1 2019, supported by the technology solutions provider for the London Stock Exchange Group.

The much-anticipated digital assets platform Bakkt, created by the operator of the New York Stock Exchange, recently completed a $182.5 million funding round.
