###### 2019-02-24 15:02

Cryptocurrencies will have to spend a long time forming large bases, upon which the next bull phase will be built.

## EOS/USD

EOS has been on a roll and has emerged as the best performer among the major cryptocurrencies, rising by about 35 percent in the past seven days.

## BCH/USD

Coinbase will release a new wallet update over the next few weeks that will support Bitcoin Cash (BCH).

Major Malta-based cryptocurrency exchange OKEx has added Bitcoin Cash support to its customer-to-customer (C2C) trading platform.

## BNB/USD

Binance launched the testnet of its new decentralized exchange, Binance DEX, on Feb. 20.

Although we have been bullish on the pair for the past few weeks, we were unable to spot a reliable pattern or a good stop loss point.

## XLM/USD

Head of Blockchain Development & Digital Currencies at IBM, Jesse Lund, has hinted at a new partnership with Stellar (XLM), which has boosted the cryptocurrencyâ€™s prices.
