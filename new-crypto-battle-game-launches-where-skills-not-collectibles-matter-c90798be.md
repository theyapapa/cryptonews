# New Crypto Battle Game Launches Where Skills, Not Collectibles, Matter ...

###### 2018-11-10 12:11

Ether Kingdoms believes gamers want more than an opportunity to collect virtual assets – and it has created an “exciting and engrossing game that can make real money for the player.”

Each imp has distinctive characteristics, and gamers can send them into battle against other players if they wish.

Rare and desirable artefacts are available throughout the game, and these have the potential to make the imps stronger – giving players the upper hand when they’re challenging someone.

When it comes to the mining element of the game, players can open access to new mines as they advance through levels.

To ensure a player always has someone to battle on demand, Ether Kingdoms has created “highly trained bots” which imitate the characteristics of imps and create an “absolutely equal” chance of victory.

By the end of this year, players will be able to engage in a completely new game mode – Exploring Area, where they can fight with other players for different objects and explore dungeons.

Starting in 2019, global game events for groups are going to be launched – and players will be able to organize themselves into clans and do battle for “the rarest artefacts and the most valuable prizes.”
