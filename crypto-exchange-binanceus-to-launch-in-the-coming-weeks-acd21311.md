# Crypto Exchange Binance.US to Launch ‘in the Coming Weeks’ ...

###### 2019-09-08 10:09

Major cryptocurrency exchange Binance’s United States-based branch Binance.US will launch in the coming weeks, preceded by Know Your Customer (KYC) registration a few days earlier.

According to a Medium post published by Binance.US on Sept. 6, while the launch of the trading platform itself is expected in the following weeks, KYC onboarding will start a few days earlier.

The aim of this is to ensure that users will have time to verify their accounts and deposit their funds.

## KYC requirements

To complete the onboarding process, users will be required to provide a valid government ID — driver’s license or a passport — and their social security number.

According to the post, the list of states where Binance.US will be available is not yet finalized, but it will be released before the start of the onboarding process.

As Cointelegraph reported previously, cryptocurrency enthusiasts living in the United States lost various trading options for many crypto assets since Binance became unavailable to them in September.
