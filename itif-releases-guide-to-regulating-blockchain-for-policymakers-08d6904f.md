The Information Technology & Innovation Foundation (ITIF) released recommendations for policymakers on how to regulate blockchain technology on April 30.

Founded in 2006, ITIF is an independent nonprofit institute that provides policymakers with information, analysis and recommendations for handling new technology.

In its new guide, ITIF included an array of proposals for policymakers to better regulate blockchain based on principles like technology neutrality and public-sector adoption.

The guide predicts that blockchain will likely factor into major applications such as cryptocurrencies, shared data services, smart contracts, decentralized marketplaces, authenticity tracking, and digital identity applications.

For instance, some of the E.U.’s provisions, the guide explains, are inconsistent with the tamper-proof nature of blockchain transactions.

It is possible that some users could exploit the technology to store prohibited information, but the report stresses that “current versions of public blockchains are not optimal solutions to storing or sharing illicit or pirated content.”

Generally, ITIF encourages governments to make more effort to support legitimate blockchain innovation and adoption by developing relevant regulations that do not limit blockchain-based applications out-of-hand.
