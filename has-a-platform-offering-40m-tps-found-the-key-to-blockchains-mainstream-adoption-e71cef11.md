A blockchain/DAG hybrid platform has unveiled bold plans to entice businesses to use its technology – and says its “unprecedented speed, scalability and security” has the potential to benefit enterprises that handle a high frequency of transactions.

BEXAM initially intended to serve the cryptocurrency market as a hybrid exchange which used a unique algorithm to deliver the best features of centralized and decentralized platforms alike.

By exposing greater numbers of entrepreneurs to its potential, and proving what the technology has to offer, BEXAM thinks “relevant, everyday uses of blockchain \[will\] emerge more and more.”

## A unique network structure

According to the company, the dizzying speeds that BEXAM’s network is capable of achieving are thanks to a consensus algorithm known as Proof of Rounds (PoR,) which was developed by a Japanese engineering team.

DAG stands for “directed acyclic graph” – and according to BEXAM’s white paper, the network structure of this distinctive technology means that “the number of nodes in each layer increases automatically, allowing information to be transmitted without major speed reduction.”

The Proof of Rounds algorithm was devised by a development company known as Early Works, and BEXAM has an exclusive partnership agreement to build a platform based on this concept.

A token which is native to BEXAM’s ecosystem, known as BXA, will serve as a way for enterprises to pay network usage fees and transaction fees.
