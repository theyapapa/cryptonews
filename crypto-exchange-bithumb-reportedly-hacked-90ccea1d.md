###### 2019-03-30 04:03

Today, March 30, crypto exchange Bithumb posted on Twitter that their cryptocurrency withdrawals and deposits have temporarily been paused.

In an explanation linked to the tweet, the exchange writes that at 10:15 (time zone unknown) on the 29th, they detected what they describe as abnormal withdrawals through their monitoring system.

The exchange continues that they have “secured all the cryptocurrency from the detection time with a cold wallet and checked them by blocking deposit and withdrawal service.”

According to the translated note, the incident was an “accident involving insiders” and they are conducting investigations with security companies, the cyber police agency, and KISA.

A tweet from crypto user Dovey Wan wrote that more than 3 million EOS (around $12.5 million) has been transferred at Bithumb’s cold storage level, but this is unconfirmed.

In June 2018, Bithumb had suffered a hack of around $30 million in cryptocurrencies.

In the investigation after the hack, the exchange recovered $14 million of the stolen funds.
