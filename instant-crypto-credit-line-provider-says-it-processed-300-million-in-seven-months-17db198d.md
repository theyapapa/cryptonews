Nexo enables consumers to deposit their crypto assets into a secure wallet and instantly access a flexible credit line via automated approval and without the need for credit checks.

The platform says its interest rates, which are deducted directly from a user’s available credit limit, start at an 8 percent annual percentage rate (APR) — with the company arguing that this is “much lower than the average credit card rate.”

Nexo has been featured on CV VC’s list of the 50 most important Swiss blockchain companies, and it says it is the only crypto lender that makes loans available to more than 200 jurisdictions around the world.

## Substantial growth

According to Nexo, the “ravaging bear market” in the crypto world has not affected its performance, with the company earning a net profit of $3 million within the first seven months of its operation.

Back in December, the company paid a dividend of $912,071 to holders of its native NEXO token, representing 30 percent of the profits made.

To underline why these financial results are important — with its business turning a profit, let alone being operational – Nexo cites research from Ernst & Young, which suggests that only 13 percent of the companies that conducted initial coin offerings in 2017 actually have a working product, with 71 percent have no offering on the market at all.

## Insured and secure

According to Nexo, all of the crypto assets that it holds for users are insured against third-party hacks, copying, theft of private keys, insider theft or dishonest acts of employees.
