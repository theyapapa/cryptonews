# Mt. Gox Trustee: Creditors Will Soon Receive Decisions Over Rehabilitation Claims ...

###### 2019-03-21 06:03

Nobuaki Kobayashi, trustee of the now-defunct Bitcoin (BTC) exchange Mt. Gox, has announced he has concluded the processing of creditors’ rehabilitation claims and that they will be notified of the results within days.

As previously reported, roughly 24,000 creditors are thought to have been affected by Mt. Gox’s 2011 hack and subsequent collapse in early 2014, which resulted in the loss of 850,000 BTC valued at roughly $460 million at the time.

Tokyo attorney Nobuaki Kobayashi, who was appointed to act as civil rehabilitation trustee to manage Mt. Gox’s bankruptcy estate funds, has notified the public that:

“On March 15, 2019, the Rehabilitation Trustee approved or disapproved rehabilitation claims regarding MTGOX Bitcoin exchange users’ rights to make claims against MTGOX for return of cryptocurrency and/or cash \[...\] and submitted to the Tokyo District Court a statement of approval or disapproval.”

In fall 2018, Kobayashi had published a statement disclosing that he had liquidated almost 26 billion yen (about $230 million) in Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) over four months as of early March 2018.

These liquidations — which earned Kobayashi notoriety as “Tokyo’s Bitcoin Whale” for their allegedly adverse effect on markets — were formally halted when civil rehabilitation proceedings began in June 2018.

This month, former CEO of Mt. Gox Mark Karpeles received a suspended two and a half years jail sentence after being found guilty of tampering with financial records.

Also this month, a United States court denied Karpeles’ motion to stay a separate lawsuit, which accuses him of personal liability for investors’ losses, in light of the ongoing rehabilitation proceedings in Japan.
