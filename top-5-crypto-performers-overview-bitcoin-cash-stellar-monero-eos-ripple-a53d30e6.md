# Top Crypto Performers Overview: Bitcoin Cash, Stellar, Monero, EOS, Ripple, ARK ...

###### 2018-11-03 17:11

Within the next few weeks, we should get a large range move that will start a new trend, either up or down.

## BCH/USD

This week, we have a new leader, Bitcoin Cash, that has risen about 9 percent during the past week.

Until Thursday, the price of the digital currency was languishing similar to the other cryptocurrencies.

The longer the virtual currency stays in a tight range, the sharper the next move will be.

## XMR/USD

Monero rose by just over 1 percent in the past seven days, claiming the third spot in the list of top performing cryptocurrencies with a market capitalization of more than $1 billion.

However, if the price breaks below the current tight range, it can drop to $4.49, which is a minor support.

If the bears sink the price below $0.37185, the virtual currency will complete a 100 percent retracement and drop to the critical support at $0.24508.
