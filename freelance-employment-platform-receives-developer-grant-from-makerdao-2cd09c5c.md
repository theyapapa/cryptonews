Blockchain-based employment platform Opolis has announced that it received a developer grant from MakerDAO, the creator of stablecoin DAI.

## MakerDAO will bring DAI payment integrations to Opolis

On Sept. 17, in a press release shared with Cointelegraph, freelance platform Opolis and MakerDAO announced that they will bring stablecoin DAI to Opolis’ blockchain-based employment platform for freelancers.

The developer grant provided by MakerDAO will enable Opolis to process DAI payments, give companies and freelancers the choice to pay and be paid in DAI, and allow for Opolis members to pay their membership fees in DAI.

Richard Brown, head of community development at MakerDAO, a type of decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that is managed solely by smart contracts and code, explained that while the freelance and gig economy offers freedom to many, it does not come without its downsides, and added:

“Maker is looking forward to seeing how Dai can help de-risk this emerging workforce.”

Through the MakerDAO collaboration, Opolis will also be able to offer health insurance, cryptocurrency and traditional retirement plans, and tax compliance automation to its members.

## MakerDAO enters retail

As reported by Cointelegraph on Aug. 16, a London-based banking alternative called Monolith provides a Visa debit card, which began supporting MakerDAO’s crypto, allowing users to pay for goods in Dai.

MakerDAO CEO Rune Christensen discussed at the time how this partnership lets Dai holders use their assets for retail, saying:

“Monolith’s solution provides a powerful way for token holders to extend the usefulness of their crypto-holdings.
