# Blockchain Network’s Hard Fork to Triple TPS and Give Users Flexible Transaction Fees ...

###### 2018-11-19 11:11

A blockchain network is preparing for the imminent hard fork to the second version of its core system on 28 Nov – with users set to benefit from flexible transaction fees and the ability to develop their own plugins with ease.

ARK has been preparing Core V2 of its platform for some time, and has stressed that its community will not be affected by the hard fork as long as they update their desktop or mobile wallets to the latest version.

## Forking out for fees

The team says one of the most exciting developments from the upgrade is its Dynamic Fees system, which enables ARK users to outline the maximum fee they are prepared to pay in order for their transaction to be completed.

ARK hopes to ensure that this system is achieved “without detracting from or confusing the seamless user experience” – and to keep its community informed, an advanced option is being made available where users can see the lowest and highest transaction fees paid over the past 30 days, in addition to the average.

## Brand-new features

Once the hard fork has been completed to Core V2, ARK says its platform will be able to handle three times more transactions per second (TPS).

Improvements have been made to simplify the process of developing plugins that leverage the power of blockchain – and according to ARK, it only takes users a few lines of code to remove or add plugins to the system.

Other notable features included in this upgrade include multisignature transactions, a brand-new API and webhook support, better verification measures, and one of the first blockchain plugin implementations that gives ARK the ability to be modular and fully customizable.
