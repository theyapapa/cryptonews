Cryptocurrency tracking resource CryptoCompare's recent study has shown that 85 percent of crypto assets allow development teams to alter their platforms.

The report was published Wednesday, Oct. 17, on CryptoCompare's website.

To create the report, CryptoCompare reviewed hundreds of crypto and blockchain projects, with experts detecting a tendency towards centralization set by utility tokens that are running on controlled servers.

The yearly taxonomy of cryptocurrencies also revealed that 55 percent of existing crypto assets are actually centralized, while 30 percent more are semi-decentralized.

However, CryptoCompareâ€™s total amount equals 101 percent instead of 100 percent, which might indicate a reporting error.

CryptoCompare's study also reveals that most cryptocurrencies can technically be classified securities.

However, 55 percent of crypto assets could be treated as securities and fall under existing regulation, CryptoCompare states.
