Coinbase Pro, the professional offering of major American crypto exchange and wallet service Coinbase, has added support for EOS (EOS), Augur (REP) and Maker (MKR).

The post states that the platform now accepts inbound transfers of EOS, REP and MKR, and will be accepting deposits for at least 12 hours before enabling trading.

In the post, the company notes that Coinbase Pro will add support for EOS and REP in all jurisdictions, except New York state, while MKR will be available in all supported jurisdictions outside the United States.

REP — Augur’s Reputation token — is the cryptocurrency underlying open-source, decentralized prediction market platform Augur.

MKR is an Ethereum-backed token, that describes itself as “a utility token, governance token, and recapitalization resource of the Maker system.”

Recently, Coinbase Pro also added support for Stellar Lumens (XLM) and Ripple (XRP), which were soon expanded to its retail offering Coinbase.com and its trading app for Android and iOS.

The exchange’s customers can now transfer funds to any user with a Coinbase account around the world using XRP and the exchange’s stablecoin USDCoin (USDC) with no fee.
