In particular, Siemens is exploring the use of blockchain in the transportation industry, as per a report by Forbes on July 15.

According to Siemens Corporate Technology’s head of cybersecurity and blockchain, Andreas Kind, Siemens is looking to incorporate blockchain tech into carsharing via Siemens Mobility — one of Siemens’ subsidiaries.

Kind said he believes that this type of technology could be improved via a blockchain solution:

"It's not only inconvenient for the drivers, it's inconvenient for the companies because fueling cards get stolen \[and\] they get sold on the internet \[...\] That's an example where, in an industrial context, you need something, a technology, that brings together different participants that \[don't\] fully trust each other \[...\] That's exactly where blockchain can add value."

Siemens is also considering other areas within the transportation sector for blockchain solutions.

Siemens' Corporate Technology reportedly presented on a possible blockchain solution for “blockchain-based smart parking” at Bosch's 2019 Connected World conference.

According to the report, Siemens is also considering blockchain use cases for supply chains and manufacturing.

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Grand View Research has suggested that blockchain is a digital technology driving market growth in the global transportation management systems (TMS) sector.
