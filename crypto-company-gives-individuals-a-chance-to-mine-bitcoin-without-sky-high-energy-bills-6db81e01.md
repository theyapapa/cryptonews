However, the market has changed from the early days of cryptocurrency, when Bitcoin was in plentiful supply, as few knew about the opportunity and high mining rewards could be gained by individuals using a small setup at home.

In response, a novel alternative has emerged for those who are reluctant to purchase expensive equipment and pay astronomical electricity bills: cloud mining powered by remote data centers.

## “Affordable and fuss-free”

Hashing24 says its remote Bitcoin mining services give consumers a chance to lease hashing power from industry-leading data centers that have already done the heavy lifting by investing in their own hi-tech equipment for mining cryptocurrencies — predominantly Bitcoin.

As an alternative, remote mining services can enable individuals to enter into agreements with data centers that know what they are doing.

Hashing24 sends the mining order to huge processing centers based across Europe, which use equipment with a 100% uptime, and minted coins are delivered on a daily basis.

According to Hashing24, remote mining is not something that is to be embarked on lightly — and there are a multitude of factors that individuals need to take into account.

Hashing24 says one way of weighing up the costs and benefits can be through using a mining calculator, which takes a multitude of factors into account to provide a projection of potential returns in the future.
