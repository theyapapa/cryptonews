During the weekend, Bitcoin seems to have lost some of its traction with what some call a classic “buy the rumor, sell the news” reaction to Bakkt's soft launch of its digital-asset custody warehouse.

When Bakkt tweeted about its soft launch opening, Bitcoin’s price fell from $10,900 to $10,200.

The number one altcoin Ether (ETH) is seeing some upward price movement and is currently trading at $180 per coin, up 0.43% on the day.
