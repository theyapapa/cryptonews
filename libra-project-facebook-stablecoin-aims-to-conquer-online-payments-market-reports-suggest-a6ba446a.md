Most recently, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported that Facebook is talking to major payment networks Visa and MasterCard to raise a $1 billion for its crypto project, which reportedly entails a stablecoin along with a crypto-powered online payments system.

Specifically, Bloomberg reported that the social media company is making a cryptocurrency for users of the messaging service WhatsApp, which Facebook acquired for $19 billion back in 2014.

In February 2019, The New York Times wrote that Facebook is “hoping to succeed where Bitcoin failed,” revealing more details about the social media titan’s alleged crypto project.

The new WSJ story follows previous reports centered on the social media giant’s secretive project, and mentions even more concrete plans.

Furthermore, the social media behemoth might start paying its users with Facebook Coin — the unconfirmed name of the token — for viewing ads, shopping on Facebook or interacting with other content.

Eyal Shani, a blockchain researcher at consulting group Aykesubir, says that Facebook Coin “definitely” seems to be a cryptocurrency:

“If done correctly, even a centralized stablecoin together with the large user base can potentially lead to new innovative ideas for the payments world.

But Facebook's efforts to create a stablecoin could disrupt payments from players like Visa, Mastercard and Western Union in the long term, Martin said to Cointelegraph:

“To me, this is similar to JP Morgan creating their own coin, Goldman \[Sachs\] investing in the cryptocurrency custodian Bitgo, and the owner of NYSE, ICE, making a huge push in the crypto space with Bakkt.
