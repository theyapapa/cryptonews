Digital Asset, the firm that created the DAML smart contract programming language, has partnered with major cloud computing company VMware, according to an announcement on April 11.

According to the press release, Digital Asset will integrate its Digital Asset Modelling Language (DAML) on VMware’s blockchain platform.

Senior Director of Blockchain at VMware Michael DiPetrillo said:

“DAML has been proven to be one of the few smart contract languages capable of modeling truly complex workflows at scale.”

Yesterday, Digital Asset announced a collaboration with the International Swaps and Derivatives Association to develop a new tool that can support the use of smart contracts for derivatives trading.

Digital Asset stated that its DAML programming language will allow for greater automation of derivatives trade management via the use of DAML.

Digital Asset open sourced DAML earlier this month.

As of April 4, the source code for the DAML language is freely available under the Apache 2.0 open source license.
