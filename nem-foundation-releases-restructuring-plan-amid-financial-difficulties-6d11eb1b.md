# NEM Foundation Releases Restructuring Plan Amid Financial Difficulties ...

###### 2019-03-08 21:03

The NEM Foundation has released its plan for a financial and organizational restructuring on March 8.

The plan comes in the wake of news earlier this year that the foundation was running low on its native XEM tokens.

On Feb. 20, the foundation decided to release 210 million XEM tokens ($8.7 million) from reserves, the first 25 million ($1.04 million) of which will be used “to set up processes and structures for a new product-focused, revenue-driven approach for NEM Foundation.”

The new tokens will purportedly fund the NEM Foundation’s efforts through Feb. 2020.

The NEM Foundation purportedly ran into financial difficulties due to redundant roles, inconsistent success metrics, little accountability for funds and a questionable return on investments.

Per Friday’s announcement, the NEM Foundation will set up a “transformation task force” to work on short term goals including the development of weekly and monthly reporting structures for employees and a scorecard for grading employee performance.

The NEM Foundation was founded in 2017, two years after the release of the XEM token, and is based in Singapore.
