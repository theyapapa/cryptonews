###### 2019-03-30 07:03

Hasegawa Jun, the founder of Omise — the company behind OmiseGo (OMG) — denied the recent acquisition rumors in correspondence to Cointelegraph Japan on March 30.

On March 29, cryptocurrency news outlet The Block Crypto reported that Charoen Pokphand Group, Thailand’s largest private company, had acquired Omise for $150 million.

Shortly afterward, Omise answered an inquiry by Cointelegraph Japan, denying the rumors.

In his correspondence with Cointelegraph, Jun further noted that he requests The Block to immediately remove the story, publish an apology statement and issue a correction to the article.

According to him, the rumor may have an adverse effect on Omise Holdings, its subsidiaries and the company that is rumored to have carried out the acquisition.

Lastly, Jun warns that Omise is considering undertaking legal action against the outlet if The Block doesn’t respond by March 30 and comply with the requests.

As Cointelegraph reported in November last year, OmiseGo partnered with blockchain protocol Mass Vehicle Ledger (MVL) to develop a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) to ascertain whether the decentralized OMG Network is suitable for MVL’s data record-keeping system.
