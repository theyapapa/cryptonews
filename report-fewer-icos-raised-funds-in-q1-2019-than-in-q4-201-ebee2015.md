Per the ICO Market Quarterly Report, containing analytics and trends in the industry for Q1 2019, in Q1 there were almost 350 ICO projects, which is fewer than in Q4 2018.

The report further reads:

â€œNotably, in Q1 2019 there were twice less ICOs projects that have raised funds comparing with Q4 2018.

The success rate of ICOs that raised a positive amount of funds in Q1 2019 is nearly the same as in Q4 2018 even though the amount of ICOs have declined.

Q1 reportedly closed with 328 ICO projects, wherein 107 of them managed to raise funds and 221 did not raise funds.

Among the most popular industries engaged in ICOs in Q1, the report notes virtual reality, big data, artificial intelligence (AI), and entertainment.

Earlier in April, ICO analytics website TokenData released a report revealing that in Q1 2019, ICO projects raised about $118 million.

The report also revealed that of the 2,500 projects that TokenData tracked since 2017, purportedly only 45 percent successfully raised money, and only 15 percent of tokens issued in successful ICOs are trading at or above their original price.
