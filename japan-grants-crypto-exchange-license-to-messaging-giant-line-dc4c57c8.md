# Japan Grants Crypto Exchange License to Messaging Giant LINE ...

###### 2019-09-06 05:09

LVC Corporation, the digital asset- and blockchain-focused arm of Japanese messaging giant LINE, has obtained a crypto exchange operating license from Japan’s financial regulator.

## Trading for 5 major cryptocurrencies

As previously reported, LVC Corp.’s trading platform, to be dubbed BITMAX, will enable Line’s 80 million users in Japan to buy and sell multiple major cryptocurrencies.

In July 2018, LINE had launched the Singapore-based, global user-focused crypto exchange BITBOX — and will reportedly repurpose the platform’s back-end infrastructure for its Japanese FSA-approved platform BITMAX.

Due to Japan’s crypto exchange license requirements — in force since the amendment of the country’s Payment Services Act in April 2017 — BITBOX is not accessible for Japanese traders.

## LINE’s native token and mainnet

LINE launched its native Link cryptocurrency in late summer 2018 and has since continued to develop a token ecosystem based on its service-oriented blockchain, Link Chain.

The blockchain network also allows for decentralized applications to be directly applied to Line’s messaging platform.

While previous reports indicated that BITMAX, too, will support LINK trades, CT Japan has not indicated that the FSA has formally authorized the token in its list of approved cryptocurrencies for the forthcoming platform.
