Vertex Ventures has announced an investment in the largest cryptocurrency exchange Binance to facilitate its expansion into Singapore, according to a press release shared with Cointelegraph Oct. 23.

According to the release, the investment is a joint effort between Vertex Ventures China and Vertex Ventures Southeast Asia and India, and aims to support Binance in developing a cryptocurrency-fiat exchange in Singapore, along with other crypto-fiat services throughout South Asia.

Binance initially announced its plans to build a crypto-fiat exchange in Singapore in September.

Commenting on Binance’s plans to break into the Southeast Asian market, Wei Zhou, CFO at Binance, said that the exchange “look\[s\] forward to building up the blockchain ecosystem and working with all stakeholders in Singapore to support continued innovation in the local fintech space.”

Binance’s operations in Singapore are subject to Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) compliance.

Earlier this month, Binance announced the launch of its fiat-to-crypto exchange in Uganda.

Chainalysis will purportedly ease the process of KYC and AML compliance programs through the use of real-time monitoring to track the provenance of each transaction made on Binance’s platform.
