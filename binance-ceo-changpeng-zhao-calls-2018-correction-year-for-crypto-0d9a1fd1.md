Changpeng Zhao called 2018 a “correction year” for crypto currencies while expressing optimism for the future of the crypto industry during a Bloomberg interview published on Dec. 19.

Zhao, the CEO and co-founder of major cryptocurrency exchange Binance, said that “it’s a correction year.”

When asked about how the price correction affected Binance’s plans, Zhao said that Binance launched one fiat exchange, plans to launch two or three “in the next month or so,” and ten more fiat exchanges next year.

In regard to increased regulation and government involvement in the crypto space, Zhao said that the crypto industry “want\[s\] clarity, there is still too much uncertainty in many countries in the world.”

He specified that the crypto industry “want\[s\] regulation that promotes innovation, and not things that just totally hamper \[it\].”

Binance has expanded its activities beyond those of a traditional crypto exchange.

Binance Labs, the firm’s innovation wing, launched its Incubator Program in August 2018.
