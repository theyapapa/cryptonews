The digital assets-focused blockchain-based protocol, Aventus, revealed its next code release Aventus Classic designed to create a more equitable and transparent ticketing industry.

## Alleviate fraud and provide transparency

On Sept 12, Aventus Network announced in a blog post the release of Aventus Classic, a fully decentralized open-source Ethereum-based ticketing protocol designed to stop fraud and provide more transparency to the event ticketing industry.

The announcement goes on to say:

“This release marks our first real step in engaging with the open-source community, as Aventus Classic will now be open to contributions from anyone and will no longer be solely developed by official partners of the Aventus Protocol Foundation.”

## $15,000 prize fund for blockchain developers

The release of the new ticketing protocol coincides with a $15,000 prize competition for blockchain developers.

In partnership with The Satoshi Awards, developers are asked to build a blockchain-based ticketing system, where the winner will be awarded $15,000 worth of Ether.

Steve Ellis, CEO, and founder of The Satoshi Awards said they are thrilled to have partnered with Aventus and engage the open-source community to help build its ticketing system with Aventus as the backend.

He added:

“We are excited to see the entries start rolling in and couldn’t think of a better way to manage our tickets than through blockchain to promote trust, transparency, and innovation.”
