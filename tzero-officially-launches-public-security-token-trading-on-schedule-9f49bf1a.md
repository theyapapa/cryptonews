# TZERO Officially Launches Public Security Token Trading оn Schedule ...

###### 2019-08-12 14:08

Retail giant Overstock’s blockchain subsidiary company, tZERO, has opened up its preferred equity security tokens — dubbed TZROP — for trading by accredited and non-accredited investors.

According to the announcement, the TZROP token allows investors to directly participate in the company’s revenue growth via a quarterly dividend model.

The company additionally specifies that it could pay out these dividends in U.S. dollars, Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) or even with more security tokens.

## Democratization of access to blockchain markets

The company’s CEO, Saum Noursalehi, framed this development as a milestone in democratizing the blockchain capital market sector for investors:

“Following the one-year anniversary of the close of our security token offering, non-accredited investors now have the ability to purchase and trade in our security tokens.

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, tZERO initially offered its secondary trading of security tokens, to accredited investors only, on Jan. 24.

At the time, Noursalehi similarly characterized the sale as democratizing access to global markets, commenting:

“The world of security tokens has lacked a regulated venue for secondary trading.

This will create liquidity, democratize access, bring transparency and efficiency to global markets and accelerate the adoption of security tokens.”
