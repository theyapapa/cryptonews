Another vote about whether to raise the so-called stability fee for Maker’s ethereum (ETH)-based DAI decentralized stablecoin by 3% has started on the governance portal of the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) on April 19.

MakerDAO, which issues the USD-pegged aforementioned algorithmic decentralized stablecoin, is seeking to improve the token’s peg by increasing the yearly stability fee.

The stability fee is a charge levied by Maker participants when Dai is used for loans.

In March, the DAO already raised the stability fee twice, first to 3.5%, and then to 7.5% per year.

Also last week, the fee was further increased by another 4% in the fifth such vote this year, bringing it to 11.5%, where it currently stands.

If the increase will be accepted again, the fee will reach 15.5%.

One user expressed concern, stating that the frequent changes to the stability fee, according to him, turns the system into an unpredictably short term leverage system.
