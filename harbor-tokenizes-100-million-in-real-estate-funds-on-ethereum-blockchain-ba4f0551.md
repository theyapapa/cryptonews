The startup Harbor announced a partnership with Seattle-based real estate investment firm iCap Equity to tokenize $100 million in real estate funds.

On Sept. 16, Harbor announced in a blog post that iCap Equity is using Harbor’s blockchain-enabled platform to improve its liquidity in four of its real estate funds which manages over $100 million in assets.

The partnership between the two companies will allow iCap Equity’s investors and placement agents to buy and sell iCap securities with one another.

Tokenization of the funds will purportedly improve liquidity for real estate investors.

Chris Christensen, iCap Equity CEO added:

“iCap provides high-yield investment opportunities for investors, but those investments typically come with a 3 to 5 year lock-up period because they are based in real estate.

## Tokenization giving more access to investors 

As Cointelegraph recently reported, the Liechtenstein Cryptoassets Exchange is tokenizing a $25 million movie fund together with Hollywood actor Wesley Snipes.

The fund will offer investors a share in the profit of its productions, as well as confer extra benefits such as invitations to movie premieres.
