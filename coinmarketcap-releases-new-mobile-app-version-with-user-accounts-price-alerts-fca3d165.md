###### 2019-04-16 08:04

Crypto data tracker CoinMarketCap has released a new version of its app for iOS and its first Android app today, April 16, with added features for price tracking and user accounts.

According to the website, the mobile app will include candlestick charts, daily historical open-high-low-close chart data and the option for setting price alerts on all cryptocurrencies available on CoinMarketCap.

In order to use the app, users will have to make a CoinMarketCap account and log in.

The app will also allow users to follow news from various media outlets, as well as compare cryptocurrency prices with other cryptos.

Last August, CoinMarketCap had launched a professional, paid API targeting developers and funds, which tracks crypto-based derivatives markets, with support for futures, options and over-the-counter exchanges for a monthly fee.

Also this year, CoinMarketCap noted that it would be altering its listing metrics for cryptocurrency exchanges following research that claimed most of the exchange data was faked.

The first iOS app from CoinMarketCap was launched last May in honor of the siteâ€™s fifth birthday.
