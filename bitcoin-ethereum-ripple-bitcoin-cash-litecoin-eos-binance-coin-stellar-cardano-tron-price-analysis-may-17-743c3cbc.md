# Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, EOS, Binance Coin, Stellar, Cardano, TRON: Price Analysis May 17 ...

###### 2019-05-17 18:05

## BCH/USD

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) turned down from close to the resistance line of the ascending channel on May 16.

On the other hand, if the bears sink the pair below the 20-day EMA, it can correct to the support line of the channel.

We will wait for the price to bounce off the support line of the channel before proposing a trade in it because a breakdown of the channel will turn the trend in favor of the bears.

If the price bounces off this support, the bulls will again try to breakout of the overhead resistance.

## XLM/USD

Stellar (XLM) rallied above the overhead resistance of $0.14861760 on May 16 but could not close (UTC time frame) above it.

## ADA/USD

Though Cardano (ADA) rallied above $0.094256 on May 15 and 16, it could not close (UTC time frame) above this level, which was our prerequisite for buying in our previous analysis.

## TRX/USD

Tron (TRX) closed (UTC time frame) above $0.02815521 on May 15 and thus triggered one-half of our buy recommendation given in an earlier analysis.
