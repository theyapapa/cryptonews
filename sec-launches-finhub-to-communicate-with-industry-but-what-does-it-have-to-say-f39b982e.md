# SEC Launches FinHub to Communicate With Industry, But What Does it Have to Say? ...

On October 18, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced the launch of the agency’s Strategic Hub for Innovation and Financial Technology (FinHub).

The SEC, being an independent federal agency responsible for protecting investors from fraud schemes, has been trying to regulate the crypto market in the U.S. However, due to the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies and lack of federal regulatory framework, the agency’s purview has been significantly limited: the SEC had issued numerous public warnings for investors and fought crypto scammers on a case-by-case basis in the past, but has been unable to come through with more precise, blanket regulatory solutions.

The pressure increased further in September, when a group of other lawmakers from Congress sent a letter to the SEC Chairman, Jay Clayton, asking his agency to tell investors how they plan to regulate digital currencies:

"It is important that all policy makers work toward developing clearer guidelines between those digital tokens that are securities, and those that are not, through better articulation of SEC policy, and, ultimately, through formal guidance or legislation."

As SEC Chairman Clayton states in the press release,

"The FinHub provides a central point of focus for \[SEC’s\] efforts to monitor and engage on innovations in the securities markets that hold promise, but which also require a flexible, prompt regulatory response to execute our mission."

Additionally, the FinHub’s website promotes information regarding the SEC’s activities on the crypto market: for instance, there’s a link to February’s Chairman’s testimony on virtual currencies and the agency’s investor bulletin for ICOs, along with other educational articles like “5 things you need to know about ICOs”.

## Regulatory uncertainty is still there

Whilst the FinHub seems to be a sign that the SEC is looking to apply more regulation on the crypto market, its actual output is yet unclear.

Nevertheless, the hub still represents a more advanced approach for a federal regulator to educate the masses and facilitate compliance on the market: in the past, the SEC relied on general public warnings and a mock ICO website that redirected clueless visitors to Investor.gov website.
