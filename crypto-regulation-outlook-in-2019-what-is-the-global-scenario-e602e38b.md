Since 2016, a number of countries have either banned digital currencies altogether (such as China, Pakistan and Egypt) or have placed various legal impositions on the asset class (thereby making it quite difficult for people to facilitate their daily monetary transactions using these currencies).

Also worth mentioning is the fact that no value-added tax, or VAT, is applicable on the purchase of various cryptocurrencies across the U.K. Rather, a surcharge is applicable on goods or services that are acquired in exchange for Bitcoin or other similar crypto assets.

### Australia 

The Reserve Bank of Australia seems to have an open mind toward the crypto industry — with the regulatory body stating that it does not prevent people from making use of digital currencies.

### France 

While the regulatory status of crypto is still quite murky in the region, France recently passed a bill that will see a new legal framework established to govern cryptocurrency operations — such as initial coin offerings (ICOs) — across the nation.

Additionally, due to Malta’s relaxed tax laws, a number of big name crypto firms (including Binance) have set up shop in the country (primarily to bypass some of the legal hassles that crypto businesses encounter throughout most of Europe’s major nations).

### Belarus 

Per a decree passed by Alexander Lukashenko — the president of the Republic of Belarus — local residents have the right to buy/sell crypto assets as well as create their very own digital currencies.
