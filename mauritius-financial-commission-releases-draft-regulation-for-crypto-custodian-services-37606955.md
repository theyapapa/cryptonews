The Financial Services Commission (FSC) of the Republic of Mauritius has released a draft regulatory framework for crypto custodian services, according to an official document posted on Nov. 5.

According to the announcement, the island country aims to establish regulation for custodian services for digital assets in order to enable users of crypto custodian services to have a due level of safety.

According to the draft regulation, the FSC will issue a custodian service license that will allow an entity to operate as a holder of digital assets as well as to function as safe keeper of the assets.

Crypto custodians on Mauritius will be also required to maintain at least 500,000 of Mauritian rupees (MUR) or roughly $14,000 of “unimpaired” or hard capital.

Moreover, a crypto custodian must have a board consisting of at least three directors with one of them being a resident of Mauritius, as well as the requirement of maintaining an office on the island.

The new exchange was announced yesterday, Nov. 6, by global markets exchange GMEX Group in partnership with Mauritius International Derivatives and Commodities Exchange (MINDEX) and HYBSE.

On Aug. 31, the FSC issued a warning to a local company dubbed Jennocrypto that allegedly falsely claimed to hold an investment Dealer (Discount Broker) license.
