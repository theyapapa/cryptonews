# Ditch Google and Use a Bot Instead: Startup Says the Golden Era for Search Apps Is Over ...

Rather than depend on potentially biased platforms, which often fail to capture the full breadth of nearby venues, Localflow says the future lies in conversational bots that can provide fast recommendations and a plethora of other services.

Moreover, people can use Localflow bots to create their products, assign a price — in fiat and crypto — and have them broadcasted through the chatbot’s local search network.

If the user is interested, a bot could provide them with live feedback about what is going on inside, a full list of prices, plus the ability to reserve a table and pay upfront.

For example, a seasoned guitarist would be able to use Localflow’s system to offer private tutoring, or the owner of a pizzeria could build a bot that takes orders and tracks deliveries.

Localflow believes bots could also offer a helping hand to companies behind the scenes, enabling them to keep track of stock levels and replenish warehouses when necessary.

When Localflow’s infrastructure launches, users will be rewarded with EWA — an ERC-223 compliant token designed to power its network — whenever they make contributions that would benefit other users, such as “creating meetups and high-quality social activities.”

In the year and a half that follows, the platform hopes to establish a cooperative network of local search-led chatbots and a platform for creating bots that boasts an “open collaborative interface,” plus a system that rewards users with EWA tokens.
