# Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, EOS, Litecoin, Binance Coin, Stellar, Cardano, TRON: Price Analysis April 22 ...

###### 2019-04-22 14:04

A breakout of this level can push the price towards the next overhead resistance zone of $5,674.84â€“$5,900.

Contrary to our assumption, if the bears sink the pair below the 20-day EMA, it can fall to the 50-day SMA.

If the bulls provide buying support at the current levels and carry the XRP/USD pair above $0.34835, it can move up to $0.38.

On the other hand, if the bears sink the digital currency below the 50-day SMA, it can drop to the next support of $0.27795.

But if the bulls fail to sustain the EOS/USD pair above the 20-day EMA, it might dip to the 50-day SMA.

If the bulls fail to defend the 50-day SMA, the pair can decline to the support of the channel.

Nonetheless, if the bulls defend the 50-day SMA support, the TRX/USD pair might remain range-bound between the 50-day SMA and $0.02815521 for the next few days.
