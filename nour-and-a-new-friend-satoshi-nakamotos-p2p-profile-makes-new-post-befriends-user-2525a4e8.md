# ‘Nour’ and a New Friend: Satoshi Nakamoto's P2P Profile Makes New Post, Befriends User ...

###### 2018-11-30 12:11

An account once associated with Bitcoin (BTC) creator Satoshi Nakamoto on the non-profit global network P2P Foundation posted a one-word status update yesterday, Nov. 29.

While the account is tied to Nakamoto’s old email address satoshin@gmx.com — the same address that reportedly uploaded one of the early Bitcoin papers to P2P back in 2009 — the same email was allegedly hacked in November 2014, four years after Nakamoto’s withdrawal from traceable online activity in late 2010.

Nakamoto’s abrupt disappearance in late 2010 spawned a legend almost as famous as the cryptocurrency he, she, or they invented on Oct. 31 2008 with the publication of the Bitcoin white paper.

The inventor’s first “name,” Satoshi, has also been used to christen one hundred millionth of one Bitcoin — the smallest, indivisible unit of the cryptocurrency.

Controversially self-proclaimed “Nakamoto” Craig Wright has recently been in the crypto limelight in connection with the fallout of the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) hard fork in mid-November, which led to Wright’s preferred protocol spinning off into the newly-forked Bitcoin SV (BSV) token.

(A hard fork of a hard fork, as Bitcoin Cash was itself forked from the original Bitcoin).

Bitcoin pioneer Jeff Garzik, reportedly the “third-biggest contributor” to Bitcoin’s code and one of Nakamoto's key collaborators, has recently ventured his “personal theory” that the coder Floridian Dave Kleiman is the much-mythologized figure behind the coin.
