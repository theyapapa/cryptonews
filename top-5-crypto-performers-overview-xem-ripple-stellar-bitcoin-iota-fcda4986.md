# Top 5 Crypto Performers Overview: XEM, Ripple, Stellar, Bitcoin, IOTA ...

###### 2018-11-18 07:11

The fall has been severe and has dragged several cryptocurrencies to new year-to-date lows, breaking below critical support levels.

## XRP/USD

In the recent fall, we have a new leader for altcoins: Ripple (XRP) has displaced Ethereum (ETH) and taken over the mantle of the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.

If the line holds, the digital currency is likely to rise to the top of the range at $0.76440.

## XLM/USD

Stellar (XLM) has displaced EOS to take its place among the top five digital currencies by market capitalization.

## BTC/USD

After more than two months of low volatility, the range expanded to the downside last week, plunging Bitcoin to new year-to-date lows.

If the price closes the week below $5,900, the fall can extend to the first support at $5,450 and below that to $5,000.

## IOTA/USD

This week, the carnage has been so bad that even digital currencies that have fallen in double digits have qualified as the top 5 performers.
