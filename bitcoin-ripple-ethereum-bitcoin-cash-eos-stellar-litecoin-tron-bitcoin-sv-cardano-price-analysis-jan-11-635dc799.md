# Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, EOS, Stellar, Litecoin, Tron, Bitcoin SV, Cardano: Price Analysis, Jan. 11 ...

###### 2019-01-11 15:01

In a bear market, any negative news is met with strong selling and that is what has happened over the past two days.

## BCH/USD

After consolidating for the past few days, Bitcoin Cash broke down of the range on Jan. 10.

The 20-day EMA is turning down after being flat for the past few days, which confirms that the sellers have an advantage in the short-term.

## LTC/USD

Litecoin has dipped back below the neckline after failing to rally in the past few days.

If the price sustains below the neckline for two more days, it will confirm that the recent break out of the inverse head and shoulders pattern was a fake move.

## ADA/USD

After sustaining the breakout above the neckline of the inverse head and shoulders pattern for four days, Cardano has dipped back below it.

Both moving averages are flat and the RSI is also close to the neutral territory, so the probability of a consolidation in the next few days is high.
