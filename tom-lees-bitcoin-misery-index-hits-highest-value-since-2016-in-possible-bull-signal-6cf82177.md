Wall Street strategist and co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors Thomas Lee revealed on April 11 that his “Bitcoin Misery Index” (BMI) recently hit its highest figure since June 2016.

The BMI — which Lee designed with the aim of informing investors of how “miserable” Bitcoin (BTC) holders are based on the coin’s price and volatility — reportedly hit a value of 89 on April 2.

According to Lee, the fact that Bitcoin has reported its highest reading since June 2016 provides a mixed signal.

He proposed two interpretations of the index, writing that:

“Good--> Since 2011, BMI >67 only seen during $BTC bull markets.

Bad --> BMI >67 after peak, $BTC falls ~25% = Profit taking ST.”

In a further tweet in the same thread, the strategist argued that “the main takeaway is that BMI reaching 67 is further evidence the bear market for Bitcoin likely ended at $3,000.”

As Cointelegraph has previously reported, Lee — a well-known Bitcoin bull — has used the BMI as a measure of investor sentiment as well as to assess Bitcoin’s price resilience and immediate prospects since he first launched the index in March 2018.

Bitcoin is currently up half a percent on the day and is trading around $5,079 by press time, having hit a multi-month price high of over $5,420 earlier this week on April 10.
