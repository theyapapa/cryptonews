On Aug. 14, Dovey Wan — founding partner of blockchain-based investment company Primitive Ventures — called attention to the ongoing mass sell-offs from the fraudulent Chinese investment scheme, dubbed PlusToken.

As Wan outlines, PlusToken was created in mid-2018 and promised high yield investment returns at different rebate percentages to its four tiers of member — a classic Ponzi scheme structure.

Wan has attached data on all the wallet addresses — including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and EOS — known to be associated with PlusToken and urgently called on exchanges and over-the-counter platforms to blacklist them.

Alongside the addresses, Wan has attached investigative data from security audit firm Peckshield that reveals the money flow from PlusToken’s wallet as of early July, the date the sell-offs are thought to have begun:

## Incessant sell-offs

Despite the arrest, the cryptocurrency cannot reportedly be rolled back, as Wan explains:

“Many of their BTC addresses are started with P2SH which commonly used for mutil-sig, most likely some ppl who hold the keys are not being caught hence police can’t unlock the wallet.

In an attempt to curb the impact of the sell-offs, she has recommended that Peckshield and blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis analyze the flows more closely, noting that PlusToken appears to be moving their funds in small batches of 50-100 BTC into exchanges.

Chinese traders have reportedly claimed that an unknown address has in recent days been dumping 100 BTC incessantly on crypto exchange Binance, which Wan suspects to be connected to the scheme.
