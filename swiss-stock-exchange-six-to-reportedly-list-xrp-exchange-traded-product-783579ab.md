Switzerland’s largest stock exchange SIX will reportedly launch another crypto exchange-traded product (ETP) for XRP, crypto outlet The Block writes Monday, Mar. 11.

Amun AG, a Swiss crypto startup that launched the world’s first listed crypto index product on SIX last November, has confirmed the information to The Block.

Co-founder and CEO of Amun AG Hany Rashwan told another crypto media outlet, Coindesk, that the company has also received SIX’s approval to launch four more ETPs for other altcoins — Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Litecoin (LTC), Stellar (XLM) and EOS.

As Cointelegraph previously wrote, in November 2018, SIX listed the world’s first multi-crypto-based ETP — dubbed the Amun Crypto Basket ETP — under the ticker HODL.

Later, Amun AG launched ETPs for Ethereum and Bitcoin, which trade under ticker symbols AETH and ABTC.

As per data provided by SIX exchange, the Amun Crypto Basket ETP is currently the most traded ETP by volume.

Earlier this year, SIX Swiss Exchange announced it would be testing blockchain integration for its forthcoming parallel digital trading platform Six Digital Exchange (SDX), and would use the technology to tokenize stocks, bonds and possibly ETFs.
