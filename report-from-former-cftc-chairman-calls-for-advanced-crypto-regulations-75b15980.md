# Report From Former CFTC Chairman Calls for Advanced Crypto Regulations ...

The report dubbed “It’s time to strengthen the regulation of crypto-assets” addresses the purported need for better regulation on digital currencies, the illicit use of cryptocurrencies, as well as measures for reducing the risk of cyber attacks.

The report also provides direct recommendations of how to improve existing cryptocurrency regulations.

Per the report, there is a gap in the regulation of crypto assets that contributes to fraud and weak investor protection, which is partly represented by the fact that traditional standards required for securities and derivatives market intermediaries are not applied to cryptocurrency trading platforms.

Massad writes that cryptocurrency exchanges are not properly regulated, making them vulnerable to fraud and manipulation, as well as conflicts of interest, which raises the need for regulations to minimize operational risk and implement system safeguards.

The report points out that insufficient regulatory supervision creates broader risks in respect to cyber security and illicit payments, which results in more hacking attacks.

The former CFTC Chairman suggests that the U.S. Congress has to address the aforementioned issues by developing regulatory oversight of the cash market for crypto assets, trading platforms and other intermediaries that operate in the market.

The report states that Congress should authorize the SEC to regulate cryptocurrency circulation and regulation of trading platforms, custodians, brokers and advisors.
