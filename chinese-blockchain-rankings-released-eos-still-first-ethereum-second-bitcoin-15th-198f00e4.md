China has released its latest government-sponsored rankings of major cryptocurrencies, placing Bitcoin (BTC) in 15th, while EOS keeps its top spot.

The crypto rankings by China’s Center for Information and Industry Development (CCID) were first announced in May last year.

The ninth CCID Global Public Chain Technology Evaluation Index, the first index released by the institute in 2019, places EOS first in the ranking again.

The last such index, which was released in December of last year, also placed EOS in first place.

The second position in the ranking is held by Ethereum (ETH), the same place it held in December’s rankings, after the recent postponement of the hard fork by Ethereum’s developers until late February.

Bitcoin’s current position, on the other hand, is up from the 18th place it held in December last year to the 15th.

As Cointelegraph recently reported, Ripple (XRP) — which is in the 20th place in this ranking — launched a blockchain research scholarship in partnership with a major Chinese research university last week.
