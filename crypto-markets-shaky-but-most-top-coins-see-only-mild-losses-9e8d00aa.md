Most of the remaining top ten coins on CoinMarketCap are seeing losses of below 3 percent, with the notable exception of Bitcoin Cash (BCH), which is down 5.8 percent to trade at $220.62 — a 49 percent devaluation on the month, due to the fallout of its controversial hard fork Nov. 15.

The remaining coins in the top twenty by market cap are mixed red and green, with the largest positive momentum for NEM (XEM) — seeing 3.5 percent growth on the day at $0.08 — and the heftiest losses hitting privacy-focused alt, Zcash (ZEC), which is down 4.3 percent at $82.2.
