Crypto exchange Coinbase’s user-controlled Coinbase Wallet has enabled its clients to use decentralized apps (DApps) on any desktop browser with the WalletLink service.

## Expanded access to DApps

Per an official blog post on Aug. 22, Coinbase Wallet’s users can now use their DApps on any desktop browser through WalletLink, which serves as a bridge between customers’ Coinbase Wallet app and desktop browser.

This spring, Coinbase introduced a service to link users’ accounts on its main platform to its Coinbase Wallet app, wherein Coinbase stores a customer’s cryptocurrencies and private keys.

With Coinbase Wallet, users store their own crypto protected by unique private keys.

## DApps around the world

Earlier this week, major cryptocurrency exchange Huobi added wallet support for an autonomous protocol for finance DApps called Compound.

The Huobi Wallet will support both its tokens and its DApp, which is designed for crypto lending.

Samsung previously said that the company’s DApp kit allows for account management and backup, payment and digital signature facilitation, Samsung Keystore and other cold wallet support.
