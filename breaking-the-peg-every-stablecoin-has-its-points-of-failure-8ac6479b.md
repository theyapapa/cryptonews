Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision

In the year of bear markets and curbed enthusiasm, stablecoins have emerged as the asset class with which many of the crypto community associate high hopes for the long-anticipated mass adoption.

As these cryptocurrencies have come to be viewed as a promising tool to alleviate volatility – presumably the major hurdle in the way of digital assets becoming a vehicle of everyday transactions for millions of consumers – they enjoy massive media coverage, community and investor attention, and merit somewhat over-the-top labels such as “The Holy Grail of cryptocurrencies.”

Speaking to Cointelegraph, Eric Ervin, the Founder and CEO of the financial firm Reality Shares, summarized this outlook:

“The true value that asset-backed stablecoins bring to the blockchain industry is that they will provide a realistic solution for the use of cryptocurrency in everyday transactions.

Speaking of fiat-backed stablecoins more generally, Rafael Delfin, Head of Research at Brave New Coin, voices centralization concerns:

“We consider this emerging type of crypto asset of great significance to further the development of the ecosystem.

Digital asset collateral designs: Dai

This class of stablecoins comprises those assets that are pegged to other cryptocurrencies or baskets of them.

As with other crypto-backed stablecoins, Dai’s major potential point of failure comes from volatility inherent to collateral assets – from routine “collateral volatility,” to vulnerability, to so-called “black swan” events, whereby the value of the underlying asset dramatically collapses at a speed faster than the system can sustain.

Non-collateralized designs: Basis

Finally, some developers choose to avoid pegging their stablecoins to other assets altogether.
