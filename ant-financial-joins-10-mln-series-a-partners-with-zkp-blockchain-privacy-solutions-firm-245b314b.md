Ant Financial, the financial affiliate of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, has participated in a $10 million Series A round for QEDIT, an Israeli blockchain privacy solutions firm that develops zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) technology.

The partnerships will reportedly see the companies cooperate with QEDIT to review their privacy products and implement ZKP technology at a corporate level.

As Calcalist notes, QEDIT develops privacy solutions for enterprise blockchains that are compatible with data privacy laws, such as the landmark European Union-wide framework General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

As well as allowing for blockchain-powered and privacy-preserving data sharing, QEDIT’s ZKP technology has been designed to be used in audit and due diligence services for financial institutions, an earlier report has outlined.

Geoff Jiang — a vice president and general manager of Ant Financial Technology and Business Innovation Group — is cited by Calcalist as saying that:

“Ant Financial shares a common vision with QEDIT to protect data privacy and security.

Together with QEDIT, Ant Financial is committed to providing such capabilities as part of our blockchain services.”

As reported in April, Dutch global banking and financial services corporation ING has recently introduced a new solution that extends its existing blockchain privacy-focused technologies such as zero-knowledge range proof and zero-knowledge set membership.
