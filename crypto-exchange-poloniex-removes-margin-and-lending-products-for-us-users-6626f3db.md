U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange platform Poloniex will remove margin and lending products for its customers in the U.S and delist three digital assets, according to an announcement published October 3.

Poloniex is a cryptocurrency trading platform founded in 2014 and designed as a digital-currency-to-digital-currency exchange.

Additionally, Poloniex will reportedly delist three cryptocurrencies; Synereo (AMP), Expanse (EXP), and Gnosis (GNO) on October 10, so customers will have to desist any trades and withdraw any balances in these assets.

In July, the Delaware Department of Justice (DoJ) investigated Poloniex after the exchange’s social media and support center accounts were besieged by users who had been locked out of their accounts.

In May, a number of customers reportedly started receiving emails in which Poloniex required them to verify their account within 14 days.

Poloniex users further took to the exchange’s unofficial subreddit, complaining about missing or “stuck deposits.”

In January, Poloniex users claimed on the exchange’s unofficial subreddit that it had not been crediting user account balances when orders were cancelled.
