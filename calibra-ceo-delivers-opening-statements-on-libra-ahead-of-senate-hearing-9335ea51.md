The United States Senate Banking Committee has released the opening statements of David Marcus, head of Facebook’s crypto wallet Calibra today, July 15.

In his testimony, Marcus raised the issue of Facebook’s upcoming stablecoin Libra and its associated digital wallet Calibra, which have previously drawn criticism from both community members, lawmakers and leading industry players.

Specifically, Marcus delivered comments on the structure and management of Libra and Calibra and their implications for commerce and consumers.

Marcus writes that no sole organization should be responsible for the Libra Blockchain and the Libra Reserve; instead, there should be a cooperative approach.

According to Marcus, Facebook will not launch Libra until the company satisfies all matters related to the stablecoin’s regulation and receives appropriate approvals.

Marcus continued:

“State financial regulators will regulate Calibra as a money transmitter, and the Federal Trade Commission and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will monitor for consumer protection and data privacy and security issues.

Per Marcus, Libra also differs from other currency-backed stablecoins as it will not have its value fixed to any single asset, specifying:

“Libra will be fully backed on a one-to-one basis through the Libra Reserve, which will hold a basket of currencies in safe assets such as cash bank deposits and highly liquid, short-term government securities.
