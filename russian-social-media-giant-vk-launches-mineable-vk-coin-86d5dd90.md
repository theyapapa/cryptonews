Russian social media giant Vkontakte (VK) has launched an internal currency, VK Coin, that can be “mined,” local state-owned media outlet Tass reported on April 1.

It does, however, encourage users to “mine” the coin via VK’s services.

The service works via a mobile app clicker game that lets users earn the internal currency, send it to other users and compete for a top winners list, based on VK Coin holdings.

According to a post from VK’s internal payment service, VK Pay, VK Coin users will soon be able to exchange their coins for various services and discounts with external partners.

By April 5, VK Coin mining has been used by more than 4 millions users, while the richest user has mined over 890 million coins, VK Pay noted.

According to local media outlet TJ, VK Coin users have started exchanging their coins for fiat money or services, such as posting ads.

VK declined to comment on whether the new coin relates to or is planned to relate to cryptocurrency or blockchain, telling Cointelegraph that the firm does not “comment on rumours.”
