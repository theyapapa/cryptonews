# Sprott CEO Predicts Bullish Future for Blockchain-Based Digital Gold ...

Peter Grosskopf, CEO of the global asset manager Sprott, has posited that blockchain technology will make gold a more valuable and practical asset, according to an interview with Kitco News on May 7.

Regarding the day-to-day usability of gold — and how blockchain improves the situation — Grosskopf remarks:

“I think it was quite realistic to criticize gold because you weren’t gonna go to a gas station and pay for your fill-up with gold coins.

But now, when gold can be digitized, put on the blockchain — moved around very easily, quickly, low cost between financial accounts, and it will even be used as a payment metric.

Grosskopf also distinguishes “digital gold” from bitcoin (BTC) due to the fact that the former — unlike the latter — is pegged to a physical asset (gold); essentially, he argues that digital gold is a type of stablecoin.

However, both bitcoin and Grosskopf’s hypothetical digital gold are similar in that they use blockchain technology to provide a secure means of tracking online transactions.

Grosskopf goes so far as to say that, due to operating on a tracked ledger, digital gold “can’t be hacked.”

Bitcoin itself has been called a form of “digital gold” in that it will purportedly provide a stable store of value at some point in future.
