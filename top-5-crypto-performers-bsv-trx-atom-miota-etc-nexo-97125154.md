While most of the BSV news was taken up by the fake news, in another development, Australian firm Tokenized launched a protocol on the BSV blockchain that can help businesses create tokens for real-world assets.

On the downside, the cryptocurrency might find support close to $152.015, which is the 50% retracement level of the rally from the recent lows.

Currently, the digital currency has been finding support close to the previous highs of $5.660, which shows demand at the first support level.

It thereafter held the retest of the breakout levels from the week before, which is a bullish sign as it confirms $0.385033 as the new floor.

During the week, the cryptocurrency easily scaled above our first target objective of $0.50, but faced some profit booking at higher levels.

Though most of the past year was spent in a crushing bear phase, the company had successfully paid a dividend of $912,071.00 to the NEXO token holders in December 2018.
