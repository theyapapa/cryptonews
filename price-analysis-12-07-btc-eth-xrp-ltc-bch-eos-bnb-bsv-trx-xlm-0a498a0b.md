# Price Analysis 12/07: BTC, ETH, XRP, LTC, BCH, EOS, BNB, BSV, TRX, XLM ...

###### 2019-07-12 13:07

## ETH/USD

Ether (ETH) broke down and closed (UTC time frame) below the 50-day SMA on July 11, which is a bearish sign.

Conversely, if the ETH/USD pair reverses direction from the 50-day SMA or the 20-day EMA, it can correct to the next support at $226.58.

Both the moving averages have completed a bearish crossover and the RSI is close to the oversold zone, which shows that bears have the upper hand.

If the recovery stalls at $111.8994 or close to the 20-day EMA, bears will attempt to sink the LTC/USD pair below the support line of the channel.

On the other hand, if bulls scale the pair above the moving averages, a rally to $140.3450 and above it to the resistance line of the channel is likely.

## BCH/USD

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) plunged below the support line of the channel on July 11.

The 20-day EMA is sloping down and the RSI is close to the oversold zone, which suggests that the bears have the upper hand.
