A new blockchain-based platform says it has bold plans to transform the events industry — eliminating middlemen to reduce costs for organizers, promoters, entertainers, suppliers and consumers alike.

## Three core values

Evedo says that it prides itself on its three core values of “trust, creativity and empathy,” and believes that its infrastructure can help those working behind the scenes on major events achieve creative and exciting results, all while reducing the amount of time and effort they spend on realizing their vision.

Its business-to-business (b2b) marketplace aims to connect organizers with the contractors and sponsors who can get their event off the ground — empowering them with the ability to easily compare fees and reputations so they find the perfect partner.

In explaining how its infrastructure works, Evedo’s white paper adds: “The B2B platform is designed as an effective search engine where the event organizer can find all resources, partners and suppliers by listing the detail regarding their planned event.

The event organizer can browse and filter by multiple criteria such as dates, type of event, expected number of attendees, specific technical equipment requirements, logistics, hotels, staff needed on site, advertising and media coverage.”

## The golden ticket to a slick event

The startup’s offering is going to be complemented by a business-to-consumer platform that is designed to weed out the problems associated with buying and selling tickets.

The platform also believes that venues would also see their profits rise, as lower ticket prices would result in a greater number of events to cater to rising demand.
