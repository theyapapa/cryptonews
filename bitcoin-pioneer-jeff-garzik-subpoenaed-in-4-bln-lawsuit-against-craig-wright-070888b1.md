Software engineer and Bitcoin (BTC) pioneer Jeff Garzik has been subpoenaed by a United States District Court in connection with the $4 billion lawsuit against Craig Wright, according to a document Garzik posted in a tweet on March 15.

The suit was initially filed last February with the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of Florida, with the family of David Kleiman — a computer scientist, whom many suspect to have been one of the developers of Bitcoin and blockchain technology — alleging that Wright stole up to 1.1 million BTC after he passed away.

Following Kleiman’s death in 2013, Wright, who proclaimed himself to be Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto, contacted his estate, allegedly claiming to want to help dispose of the Bitcoin fortune.

Now, the subpoena calls Garzik to appear in court and reveal any evidence to the “personal theory” that Kleiman was Satoshi Nakamoto.

The subpoena also requests to provide all communications, agreements and documents related to both Wright and Kleiman.

Additionally, the document asks Garzik to provide information concerning Bitcoin mining for the period between January 1, 2009 and April, 2013, and refers to the search for documents related to Silk Road, Liberty Reserve, Mt. Gox, and the Prometheus Project.

Last November, commenting on various hypotheses as to the Bitcoin creator’s identity, Garzik said:

"My personal theory is that it’s \[Satoshi Nakamoto\] Floridian Dave Kleiman.
