# Indian Crypto Exchange Coinome Halts Services Citing Regulatory Pressure ...

###### 2019-05-10 06:05

Indian cryptocurrency exchange Coinome has announced it will be halting operations as of May 15, ostensibly due to regulatory difficulties.

As Cointelegraph has reported, exchanges in the country have faced a moratorium on banking services since the central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), implemented a ban on dealings with crypto businesses last year.

Coinome, which is backed by prominent Indian online payments gateway Billdesk, has not clarified whether the suspension is in effect a total shuttering of services, tweeting only that:

“All crypto markets on Coinome will be suspended, effective 2pm on May 15th, 2019.

Coinome’s difficulties come despite its association with Billdesk, which notably is supervised by RBI, is a participant under the country’s Payments and Settlements Systems Act 2007, and has investments from two of India's leading public sector banks — State Bank of India and Bank of Baroda.

A May 10 report from local news outlet Quartz cites an alleged Coinome email which has reportedly been sent to customers, apparently providing more details of the recent development:

“India is currently going through uncertainty on crypto guidelines and regulations.

The government of India has not yet taken a decision on the regulatory framework for crypto exchanges or wallets.

As the lengthy legal battle continues, this February, the Supreme Court granted four weeks to authorities to come up with crypto regulation policies before the Court would cease hearing crypto-related cases — including parties who demand to reverse the RBI’s crypto circular.
