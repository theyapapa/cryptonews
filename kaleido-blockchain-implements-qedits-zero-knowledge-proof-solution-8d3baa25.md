Enterprise blockchain startup Kaleido, a part of ConsenSys’s venture studio, became the first to implement crypto privacy firm QEDIT’s zero-knowledge proof solution.

## An optional feature

QEDIT claims in a press release shared with Cointelegraph on Sept. 15 that this partnership with Kaleido will enable its private asset transfer feature as an off-the-shelf option for businesses using the platform.

CEO and co-founder of QEDIT Jonathan Rouach added:

“Kaleido has played a leading role in accelerating the deployment of enterprise blockchain technology by removing the need for companies to invest significant resources in custom code development.

## A notable platform

Rouach also named the Komgo blockchain as an example of Kaleido’s potential, claiming that it “is used by leading energy companies and financial institutions.”

Per the announcement, Kaleido “is the only full-stack blockchain SaaS that is enterprise and consortia-ready.”

As Cointelegraph reported in May last year, leading cloud platform Amazon Web Service partnered with Kaleido to offer simplified blockchain cloud platforms for its clients.

In November 2018, the two also launched a full-stack platform that helps enterprises implement blockchain solutions.
