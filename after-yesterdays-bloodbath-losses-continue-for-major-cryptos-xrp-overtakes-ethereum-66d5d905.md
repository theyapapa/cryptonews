Meltem Demirors, the Chief Strategic Officer (CSO) of crypto exchange-traded products firm CoinShares has subsequently commented on the recent breakdown, claiming that the cause of the sudden bear market is that institutions are “taking money off the table” due to the hard fork of Bitcoin Cash (BCH).

With that, Bitcoin Cash is suffering the biggest losses over 7 days period, at almost 30 percent as of press time, and is trading at $420.
