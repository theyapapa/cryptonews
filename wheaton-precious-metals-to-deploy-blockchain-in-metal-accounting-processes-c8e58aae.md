Precious metals streaming company Wheaton Precious Metals (WPM) will use blockchain technology to facilitate its metal accounting processes, mining.com reported on June 12.

WPM has reportedly hired software company Blockhead Technologies to deploy its blockchain-based platform STAMP to streamline metal accounting processes.

By using the platform, WPM aims to boost data management processes and conduct data analysis.

WPM is one of the world's largest precious metals streaming companies.

Some other major producers and consumers of metals around the world have also integrated blockchain into their internal processes.

In January, IBM partnered with MineHub Technologies to deliver a blockchain solution that will improve supply chain management in the mining and metals industry.

As reported last September, Hong Kong-based jewelry retailer Chow Tai Fook reportedly put records of some of its diamonds on a distributed leger developed by blockchain startup Everledger and secured by the IBM Blockchain Platform.
