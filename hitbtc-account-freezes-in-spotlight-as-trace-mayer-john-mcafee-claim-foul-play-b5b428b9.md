Cryptocurrency exchange HitBTC has yet to respond to accusations it deliberately froze account withdrawals on Jan. 1, days prior to entrepreneur Trace Mayer’s Proof of Keys event.

In a series of tweets, Mayer joined names such as crypto advocate John McAfee in voicing concern and even suspicion about HitBTC after users reported being unable to withdraw their funds.

On both Twitter and Reddit, users acknowledged that the practice of freezing accounts had occurred often in the past, and that the timing two days before Proof of Keys was not necessarily deliberate.

At press time on Wednesday, HitBTC had not addressed Mayer’s query publicly, while others added to the controversy surrounding the exchange on social media.

Bitfi, the cryptocurrency wallet manufacturer endorsed by McAfee that previously faced a publicity battle of its own, joined the furore, claiming HitBTC was stealing money from its users.

The user stated that after HitBITC had written in an email that “No further automated restrictions will be applied,” the exchange has allegedly blocked his BTC withdrawals and frozen his account.

Another Reddit user posted about his locked funds after submitting KYC requirements, leading to a purported HitBTC support person, user paola\_balzano, to comment asking for a support ticket number to provide a follow up.
