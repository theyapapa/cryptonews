# US Senators Grill Facebook on Privacy, Trust Issues in Libra Hearing ...

At the ongoing hearing on Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency project with the Banking Committee of the United States Senate, lawmakers are interrogating Facebook on privacy and trust concerns.

As a Cointelegraph correspondent reports on July 16, David Marcus, head of Facebook’s crypto wallet Calibra, is stressing the project’s trust and regulatory compliance, while some senators are not convinced.

Brown also asked Marcus if there is anything elected leaders can say that will convince Marcus and Facebook that the company should not launch Libra.

When the Committee chair Mike Crapo asked Marcus why the Libra Corporation had chosen to register in Switzerland, Marcus assured the committee that they would also register with U.S. regulators.

Marcus also said that social and financial data would be entirely separate on the Calibra Network, adding that “to earn people’s trust, we will have to have the highest standards in terms of privacy.”

Senator and presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren — who is known as a cryptocurrency critic — asked about Facebook's willingness to allow data portability:

“If a Facebook user wishes to use a wallet other than Calibra, will you make it easy to allow the export of other data?”

In a statement on the stablecoin, Committee chairwoman Rep. Maxine Waters commented on the lack of uniform regulation in the cryptocurrency market and said that regulators should view Facebook’s plans for Libra “as a wake-up call to get serious about the privacy and national security concerns, cybersecurity risks, and trading risks that are posed by cryptocurrencies.”
