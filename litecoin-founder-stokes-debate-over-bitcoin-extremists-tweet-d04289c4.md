# Litecoin Founder Stokes Debate Over ‘Bitcoin Extremists’ Tweet ...

###### 2019-01-07 11:01

Litecoin (LTC) founder Charlie Lee has fired community debate with a tweet alleging that “some self-proclaimed Bitcoin Maximalists are actually Bitcoin Extremists.”

Lee also opened a Twitter survey, which has drawn over 24,300 votes as of press time and is due to expire in 6 hours, inviting users to identify as either a “Bitcoin Extremist,” “Bitcoin Maximalist,” “Altcoin Maximalist,” or “Nocoiner.”

At press time, 9 percent have identified as Bitcoin “extremists,” 48 percent as Bitcoin “maximalists,” 32 percent as altcoin “maximalists,” and 11 percent as “nocoiners.”

Lee’s remarks provoked a series of quick-witted responses — both dissenting and affirmative — including one from crypto industry figure Jameson Lopp, who quipped, “Bitcoin Supremacists, please.

Lee’s comments also provoked debates over whether Bitcoin “maximalism,” is little more than a marketing term allegedly coined by altcoin founders, as well as over Bitcoin’s prevailing brand dominance.

As of press time, the share of Bitcoin’s market capitalization in the overall crypto market cap is at 51.8 percent, according to CoinMarketCap data.

On the cusp of the new year, tokenization protocol Stellar’s co-founder and CTO Jed McCaleb — who is also one of the founders of now-defunct Japanese Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, as well as a co-founder of Ripple (XRP) — provocatively claimed that “ninety percent of \[crypto\] projects are B.S,” adding he was “looking forward to that changing” in 2019.
