The Initial Coin Offering (ICOs) industry in France represents a minor part of the global ICO market, according to a report on ICOs released by French financial markets regulator AMF (l'Autorité des marchés financiers) today, Nov. 14.

According to the recent study, the global ICO market has accounted for 19.4 billion euros ($21.8 billion) since 2014.

As the AMF reported, France has accounted for a small share of the market, with 89 million euros ($100 million) raised in 15 ICO projects, while most of ICOs were carried out in the U.S.

Concerning the internal market, the AMF emphasized a crucial role in this new type of fundraising as used by small companies in order to preserve the integrity of their capital.

The AMF revealed that local ICO projects are planning to incorporate into other industries and expect to raise up to 180 million euro ($202.6 million).

In this regard, the AMF mentioned the recent initiative by the French Ministry for the Economy and Finance that approved the Action Plan for Business Growth and Transformation bill (PACTE) dedicated to ICOs in September this year, which is now being examined in Parliament.

However, the AMF still stated that the industry needs international cooperation in order to regulate the market, given the cross-border character of the industry.
