Two executives at blockchain consortium R3 are reportedly planning to depart from the company amid a larger internal reorganization, sources familiar with the situation reported on Jan. 26.

Sources say that R3 told its employees at town hall meetings on Friday, Jan. 25, that head of global services and managing director Brian McNulty and chief administrative officer Laurel Carroll are leaving.

According to the people familiar with the situation, a memo sent to the employees by the company’s CEO David Rutter notes the creation of a new design team lead by co-founder Todd McDonald, which will be working on both product design and marketing.

Other changes reportedly outlined by the memo are the creation of a new production team that will be developing the company’s technology, lead by chief engineer James Carlyle, and the general counsel’s office is being merged with the external affairs office and now lead by managing director Charley Cooper.

R3 has not responded to Cointelegraph’s request for comment or confirmation on the changes by press time.

As well, the creation of a new finance and corporate team lead by the chief financial officer Paul Harris is reportedly noted in the memo.

The memo also purportedly described minor changes like added recruiting and human and business resources to the duties of chief of staff Zack Kavanaugh, as well as a search for a chief revenue officer to lead the sales team.
