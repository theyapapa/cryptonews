#  Latest Version of Brave Browser Allows for BAT Withdrawals ...

###### 2019-07-25 10:07

Product manager at blockchain-enabled internet browser startup Brave Browser, Alex Wykoff, announced that users using the latest software release will be able to withdraw their BAT tokens in a post on Brave’s community forum published on July 24.

## A new feature in the nightly builds

Per the announcement, users of the last nightly (unstable, in-development) version of Brave Browser are able to withdraw their BAT tokens after verifying their identity with crypto banking startup UpHold.

After the verification, users will also reportedly be able to buy additional BAT tokens, in case they wish to contribute to website maintenance and content creation more than they earn by viewing Brave Ads.

## Identity verification requirements

Wykoff explains that earning BAT through viewing ads and sending those tokens as tips and auto-contribution to content creators will work as previously.

What is new, is that to add funds from any external source — such as a credit card, bank account, or even another cryptocurrency wallet — users need to first verify their identity with UpHold.

## Major issues in the current nightly

Wykoff also admits that this release — which is not final — presents some fundamental issues such as the fact that user’s wallet address and Uphold user name will be visible to content creators when they receive a tip from them, and that only publishers with one active channel will be verified.

Lastly, other major issues are that some users may not be able to self-tip and that automatic reward deposits don’t always work correctly.
