The Indian government is actively preparing a draft bill on crypto regulation, which is expected to see light this December, according to documents obtained by digital news website Quartz India Tuesday, Nov. 20.

The government has filed a counter-affidavit yesterday, Nov. 19 in the Supreme Court of India, which is currently hearing a case filed by several crypto exchanges against the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

The document states that the Indian finance ministry panel, responsible for the draft and headed by secretary in the department of economic affairs Subhash Chandra Garg, will present its first version in December:

“Currently, serious efforts are going on for preparation of the draft report and the draft bill on virtual currencies, use of distributed ledger technology in the financial system and framework for digital currency in India.”

Quartz India reports that the draft report and bill will be sent out to members of the inter-ministerial committee (IMC), and that the next meeting of the IMC will specifically discuss the draft legislation.

During the hearing, the Supreme Court set a two-week deadline for the Indian government to announce its official stance on crypto.

Shortly after the hearing, the Indian secretary of Economic Affairs recommended that the country’s Ministry of Finance to impose a ban on “private cryptocurrencies.”

As Cointelegraph previously reported, while the legal crypto framework in India remains unclear, Indian authorities arrested the developers of country’s first Bitcoin (BTC) “ATM” in the city of Bangalore under criminal charges.
