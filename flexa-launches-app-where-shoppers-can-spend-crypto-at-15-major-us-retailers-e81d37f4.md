# Flexa Launches App Where Shoppers Can Spend Crypto at 15 Major US Retailers ...

Payments startup Flexa unveiled an app where consumers can spend cryptocurrencies at major American retailers.

Tyler Spalding, the company’s co-founder, announced to attendees that Spedn is already live — and an accompanying news release confirmed that Barnes & Noble, Bed Bath & Beyond, GameStop, Lowe’s, Nordstrom, Office Depot and Whole Foods Market are among the stores now accepting payments via the Flexa network.

Spalding stated that Spedn’s goal is to make cryptocurrencies spendable everywhere while ensuring merchants receive payments exactly like they did before.

In a nod to the importance of simplicity when making crypto payments in brick-and-mortar stores, the Flexa executive said transactions can be made in three steps: adding crypto to the Spedn wallet, tapping a supported brand and scanning a code.

In its news release, Flexa said Spedn was the result of 16 months of work behind the scenes, with the motivation of reducing processing fees and eliminating fraud for merchants.

Instead of adding crypto payments as a feature to debit cards, the startup said it has taken a different approach by forging direct connections with retailers in order to go around the existing payments infrastructure.

Although Spedn is initially only available to Consensus attendees, Flexa says more invites are going to be released through the app itself.
