Blockchain can make the infrastructure of new renewable energy markets across the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) more secure, resilient and cost-efficient, experts from United States-based tech consultancy firm Booz Allen Hamilton have said.

In light of a global target to generate 50 percent of the world’s energy from renewable sources by 2050, Booz Allen Hamilton — which reported almost $5 billion in revenue in the first three quarters of fiscal 2019 — isolated blockchain as the most effective technology for meeting the considerable technical, governance and institutional challenges ahead.

Dr. Adham Sleiman — vice president at Booz Allen Hamilton, Middle East and North Africa — argued that the renewable energy sector is particularly well suited for the technology, as its system is a transactional one (electricity and fares) that currently relies on a central authority (utility operators), Al Bawaba notes.

Blockchain applications can help with enabling P2P energy trading, tracking renewable energy, and articulating smart contracts.”

According to Al Bawaba, the vice president continued to argue for the potential of transactive energy concepts that are well suited to blockchain innovation, which he identified as “a major disruptive change that the energy sector may face within the next 10 years.”

As reported this January, major Spanish energy firm Iberdrola has begun using blockchain to monitor and track the sources of sustainable energy with an open source blockchain platform from the Energy Web Foundation (EWF).

In Asia, South Korea’s largest power provider KEPCO is set to use blockchain to develop an eco-friendly microgrid, and Singaporean utility firm SP Group launched a blockchain marketplace to trade solar energy last fall.
