The honorary degree was granted by dean Aleksander Berentsen, Professor of Economic Theory and Dean of the Faculty of Business and Economics during the university’s annual celebration “Dies academicus” that took place on Friday, Nov. 30.

The University of Basel specifically noted Buterin’s “groundbreaking” contribution to promoting the idea of decentralization, as well as “equal participation in the digital revolution.”

The faculty emphasized that Buterin “wrote his scientific papers without a degree and commitment to a university.”

In early November, Buterin revealed some details of the upcoming upgrade to the Ethereum network.
