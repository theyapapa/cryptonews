Bitcoin (BTC) was starting to reverse upwards July 12 as a critical tweet from United States president, Donald Trump, became a hot talking point across cryptocurrency.

Volatility has lessened over the past nine hours, despite the first-ever public comments from Trump on crypto, which turned out to be highly negative.

“I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air,” he tweeted earlier.

Similarly dismissive of Facebook’s Libra digital currency protocol, Trump’s Bitcoin bashing nonetheless failed to leave any impression on markets, with BTC/USD showing no change in behavior after the tweets went live.

“Well done (Donald Trump) for bringing more awareness to (Bitcoin),” one popular response read, sharing data from Google Trends.

Others tried to convince Trump to reevaluate, including Tron CEO, Justin Sun, who invited him to his existing charity dinner showdown with fellow Bitcoin bear Warren Buffett.
