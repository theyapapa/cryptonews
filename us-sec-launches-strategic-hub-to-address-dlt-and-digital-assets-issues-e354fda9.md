The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has launched the agency’s Strategic Hub for Innovation and Financial Technology (FinHub), according to an official announcement published Oct. 18.

The FinHub will be run by Valerie A. Szczepanik, Senior Advisor for Digital Assets and Innovation and Associate Director in the SEC's Division of Corporation Finance.

The hub aims to facilitate the SEC’s engagement in the fintech-related fields, including, among others, distributed ledger technology (DLT) and digital assets.

Per the statement, FinHub’s main objectives are to provide a portal for industry and the public to engage directly with SEC staff, promote information regarding the SEC’s activities, and serve as a liaison to other domestic and international regulators in the fintech field.

SEC Chairman Jay Clayton stated:

"The SEC is committed to working with investors and market participants on new approaches to capital formation, market structure, and financial services, with an eye toward enhancing, and in no way reducing, investor protection.

Following innovative developments in the fintech field, other financial watchdogs around the world have also restructured in order to more effectively regulate and monitor DLT and the cryptocurrency industry.

The new Strategy Development and Management Bureau, which replaced the Inspection Bureau, will develop a financial strategy policy and handle issues addressing the digital currencies market, fintech, and money laundering.
