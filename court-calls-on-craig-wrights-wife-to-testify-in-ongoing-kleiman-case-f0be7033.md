Judge Bruce Reinhart, who is overseeing the ongoing Kleiman v. Wright case, has requested international assistance in order to call Ramona Watts, Craig Wright’s wife, to the stand.

Judge Reinhart sent his request to the Senior Master of the Queen’s Bench Division of the High Court in Strand, London, according to a court filing dated July 22.

As per the filing, Judge Reinhart sent the request because he believes that the witnesses being called — three in total — have directly relevant evidence pursuant to the case.

Among these are Wright’s supposed creation of Bitcoin, communications made between David Kleiman and Wright, and information on the company W&K Info Defense Research.

The filing also highlights a number of areas that Wright testified on, which suggests that Watts would have knowledge of pertinent information.

The filing notes that Wright has testified about Watts, saying that he discussed how he allegedly created Bitcoin prior to their marriage.

As per the filing, the estate of computer scientist David Kleiman has accused Craig Wright of stealing hundreds of thousands of Bitcoins belonging jointly to the estate and W&K.
