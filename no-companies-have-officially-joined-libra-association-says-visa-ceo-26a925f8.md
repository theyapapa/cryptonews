Alfred F. Kelly Jr., the CEO of Visa, said that no companies have officially joined Libra.

At this stage, the 20-some companies involved with the foundation have reportedly only declared interest via a nonbinding letter of intent.

According to an apparent transcript of a Q3 2019 earnings call for Visa dated July 23, Kelly said:

"We have signed a nonbinding letter of intent to join Libra.

As per the transcript, Kelly was responding to an inquiry from Bryan C. Keane — an analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities.

Keane said there was “some confusion in the market” and asked whether Libra would be “a strategic partner for Visa or potential disruptive threat.”

Regarding Visa’s intended involvement, Kelly said that the company thinks Libra would benefit the company, provided that it can meet regulatory requirements:

“We're in discussions and our ultimate decision to join will be determined by a number of factors, including obviously the ability of the association to satisfy all the requisite regulatory requirements.

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Libra has been criticized for its choice to entrust its governance to a consortium of corporate entities.
