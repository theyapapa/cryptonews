# WSJ: SEC Opened Probe into Erik Voorhees, Crypto Loans Firm Over 2017 $50 Mln Token Sale ...

Crypto loans company Salt Lending Holdings Inc., once associated with high-profile crypto industry stalwart Erik Voorhees, is facing a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) probe over its 2017 $50 million token sale, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported Nov. 15.

Among other issues, the SEC is said to be investigating whether Salt’s 2017 token sale was a noncompliant securities offering (i.e. whether it should have been registered with the SEC), how token proceeds were used, and the manner in which Salt employees received tokens.

Voorhees, who is well known as CEO of crypto exchange ShapeShift, is reported to have played a “leadership” role at Salt, and was notably listed as a “director” in an SEC filing five days ahead of the first SALT token sale in August 2017.

Keith Higgins, chairman of the securities and governance practice at Ropes & Gray LLP and a former SEC division director, told the WSJ that:

“A provision in the \[2014\] settlement makes him a so-called ‘bad actor’ unable to rely on an SEC safe harbor for private, unregulated stock sales.”

Aside from being listed on Salt’s summer 2017 SEC filing, Voorhees was also named as a Salt director on the company’s site and promotional materials, according to the WSJ’s review.

In November 2017, Salt reportedly amended its SEC disclosure, declaring the $1.5 million it had raised, and refraining from any mention of Voorhees.

Jennifer Nealson, a Salt executive, has confirmed to the WSJ that the firm received a February subpoena, and clarified that Voorhees was an “early contributor” to Salt, but stated he “no longer serves in any formal capacity.”
