# Fighting Crypto Hacks: Company Tackles Security Issues in Ethereum Smart Contracts ...

###### 2019-03-13 09:03

A decentralized, open-source crypto platform based on the Ethereum protocol named Callisto Network offers users free-of-charge smart contract security audits.

The company says it is aiming to find solutions for security issues in Ethereum smart contracts, which have caused millions of dollars of loss due to hacking.

Callisto intends to solve these problems for CLO, which is the company’s native token, and Ethereum Classic (ETC) ecosystems with its official smart contract auditing department of CLO and ETC. “This represents a completely free opportunity for a professional smart contract developer to audit their smart contract,” the startup says.

## The audit workflow

The audit is free for smart contract developers and development teams.

“The benefit is that this reduces risk and smart contract vulnerabilities and increases the adoption of programmable blockchains for the whole crypto industry,” the company says.

The startup assures that there are at least three members on the team who review the smart contract’s code and provide the audit report.

Last year, the startup also managed to launch an explorer with advanced features, such as a token explorer, testnet support (for Callisto, Ethereum and Ethereum Classic) and readable transactions — including instructions for smart contracts.
