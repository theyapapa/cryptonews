Bitcoin dominance — or the percentage of the total crypto market cap that is Bitcoin’s — has been steadily near 54 percent today.

Among the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap, TRON (TRX), the eleventh largest, has seen the most notable change over the past 24 hours to press time, up a solid 3.66 percent.
