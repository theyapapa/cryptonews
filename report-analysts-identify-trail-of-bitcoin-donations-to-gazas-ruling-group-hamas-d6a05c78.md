An Israeli blockchain intelligence firm claims to have identified proof of donations in Bitcoin (BTC) reaching Hamas, the de facto ruling authority of the Gaza Strip in Palestine.

Globes reports that a BTC wallet address for receiving the funds was first published Jan. 31 to the organization’s Telegram channel.

The address has subsequently been identified by blockchain intelligence firm Whitestream as one hosted by U.S. crypto wallet service provider and exchange Coinbase.

Whitestream estimates that around $2,500 in donations were made within two days of the first wallet address publication.

One of the donations to the first address has reportedly been traced to a crypto trader in Khan Yunis in the Gaza Strip, alongside donations identified from addresses hosted by Hong Kong-based exchange Binance and Russian platform Vilkov.

Between Feb. 2 and Feb.4, further donations have been traced from a Bitcoin wallet connected with Cayman Islands-registered CoinPayments, as well as another one connected with Binance.

Donations to the Brigades’ second wallet have reportedly included donations from wallets hosted by U.S. exchanges Bittrex and Coinbase, Binance and Vilkov, as well as coming via mixing services provider coinMixer.io.
