# Hacker Moves 2.09 Mln EOS Following Blacklist Update Failure ...

An anonymous hacker managed to move 2.09 million EOS ($7.7 million) from a hacked account due to an alleged failed update by an EOS block producer (BP), according to a Telegram post by EOS block producer EOS42 on Feb. 23.

The EOS blockchain has a feature that requires BPs to blacklist compromised accounts; all top 21 BPs are required to blacklist a certain account in order for the blacklist to function properly.

On Feb. 22, a new EOS block producer dubbed “games.eos” apparently did not update the blacklist for EOS mainnet accounts.

Subsequently, the security team of major global crypto exchange Huobi — using blacklist data from EOS Core Arbitration Forum (ECAF) — detected assets pouring from EOS blacklisted accounts into Huobi accounts.

Huobi subsequently froze the accounts and the associated assets, according to a tweet on Feb. 23.

Following the accident, EOS42 made a new proposal, suggesting to nullify keys of blacklisted accounts instead of providing a veto power to a single BP on the EOS mainnet.

Per EOS42, the option to nullify keys is more effective than a “‘broken’ blacklist” and still allows an account to be saved and returned to its rightful owner.
