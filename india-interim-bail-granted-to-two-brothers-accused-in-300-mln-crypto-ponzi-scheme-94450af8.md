# India: Interim Bail Granted to Two Brothers Accused in $300 Mln Crypto Ponzi Scheme ...

The Supreme Court of India has granted interim bail to two brothers who are among the chief suspects accused of running a Bitcoin (BTC)-related Ponzi scheme.

Amit Bhardwaj and his brother, Vivek Bharadwaj, have succeeded in their appeal for interim bail, which they had reportedly requested in November 2018, with Amit asked to deposit ₹10 crores (~$1.5 million) for the bail, Inc42 writes.

As previously reported, the Bhardwaj brothers had been arrested on April 4, 2018 for allegedly defrauding around 8,000 investors out of ₹2,000 crores (about $300 million) via the GainBitcoin scheme, which they co-founded in 2013.

Speaking of the Supreme Court’s latest decision, Bhardwaj’s lawyer, Deepak Prakash, has reportedly clarified that:

“While Amit Bhardwaj has been granted interim bail based on his health ground, the Supreme Court granted bail to his brother, purely based on the merits of the case.”

A decision on the brothers’ further request — that the court cancel all 12 existing cases listed against them across multiple states in India — has been deferred until a later Supreme Court hearing, reportedly likely to be held on April 27.

Moreover, Inc42 reports that Amit Bhardwaj’s hearing at the Supreme Court has now been delayed until April 22, having initially been set for April 2.

Inc42 notes that not only the the Bhardwaj brothers, but also three other suspects — Ayush Varshney, Rupesh Singh and Sanchit — have all succeeded in having their interim bail requests approved to date.
