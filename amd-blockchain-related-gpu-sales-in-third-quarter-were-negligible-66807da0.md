In its quarterly financial results report published Oct. 24, semiconductor manufacturer AMD reveals that “blockchain-related graphics processing unit (GPU) sales in the third quarter were negligible.”

American semiconductor company AMD stated in its third quarter 2018 financial report that revenue rose to $1.65 billion, up 4 percent year-over-year, although the figure is below estimates of $1.7 billion.

The decrease is attributed to overall lower graphic revenue in the company’s Computing and Graphic business segment since last quarter.

Nevertheless, AMD’s Computing and Graphic segment revenue saw a 12 percent increase year-over-year up to $938 million primarily due to strong sales of Ryzen desktop and mobile products.

Per the AMD report, for the fourth quarter of 2018 AMD expects revenue to be around $1.45 billion, up approximately eight percent year-on-year; in the fourth quarter of 2017, revenue was reportedly $1.34 billion.

After the report was release today, the AMD stock price slumped, closing down 9 percent to $22.79, according to Nasdaq.

Reuters attributes the drop in share price to lower than expected estimates for fourth quarter revenue.
