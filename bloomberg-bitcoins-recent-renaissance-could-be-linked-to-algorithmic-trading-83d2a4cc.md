# Bloomberg: Bitcoin's Recent Renaissance Could Be Linked to Algorithmic Trading ...

The recent crypto market jump could be linked to algorithmic trading, Bloomberg writes on Wednesday, April 3.

The industry has seen 17 new algo or quantitative funds launched since September, an amount that purportedly comprises 40 percent of crypto hedge funds started during this period.

While crypto funds in general lost around 72 percent due to the 2018 bear market, these algo funds reported on gains of between 3 percent and 10 percent per month during the so-dubbed crypto winter.

Bloomberg states that Bitcoin’s (BTC) unexpected 20 percent surge price on Tuesday, April 2, shortly after the Asian markets opened, might have been provoked by a $100 million trade made on three major exchanges.

Some entrepreneurs quoted by Bloomberg think that algo trading will have a positive impact on the crypto industry.

Travis Kling, founder of the Los Angeles-based crypto hedge fund Ikigai, told Bloomberg that some of them could use fake orders to trick other traders.

For instance, Bloomberg author Eric Lam recalled an April Fool’s Day story that claimed that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had finally approved a Bitcoin ETF as possibly affecting the crypto markets.
