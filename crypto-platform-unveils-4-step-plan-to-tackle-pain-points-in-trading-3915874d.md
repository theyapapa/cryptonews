# Crypto Platform Unveils 4-Step Plan to Tackle Pain Points in Trading ...

###### 2019-07-05 10:07

An aggregated liquidity platform says it has identified four key directions for the future of crypto that will address the current points of pain in blockchain trading.

Unlike other platforms that struggle to support such channels in a compliant, regulated way, the company says it is determined to deliver fiat trading capabilities that give Visa and Mastercard owners as much freedom as consumers who have fully embraced Bitcoin and Ethereum.

BitCloud says it has sought to remedy this by integrating the order books of several high-profile crypto exchanges — delivering greater trading depth and injecting higher levels of liquidity into the whole trading process.

According to the company, its algorithmic trading technology has unlocked the possibility for so-called “iceberg orders,” in which larger movements of cryptocurrency can be divided into smaller transactions — reducing the likelihood of sudden price movements that stem from dramatic changes in the supply of a digital currency.

## From chaos to stability

According to BitCloud, the platform’s emphasis has rested firmly on being user friendly and eliminating the uncertainty that everyday consumers experience when they are trying to find suitable trading platforms.

Looking ahead, the company has bold ambitions of delivering a variety of legal channels by which users can effortlessly exchange between fiat and digital currencies — coupled with a Visa card with which crypto can be deposited and withdrawn anytime.

BPRO was recently listed on two new exchanges, and the company says it has enjoyed a surge in support for its platform, recently surpassing more than 100,000 users following the launch of its smart trading features.
