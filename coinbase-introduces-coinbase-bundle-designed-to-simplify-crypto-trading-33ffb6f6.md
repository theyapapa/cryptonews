Cryptocurrency exchange and wallet service Coinbase has rolled out a new update called “Coinbase Bundles,” which is designed to simplify cryptocurrency trading, according to an announcement published September 27.

Coinbase Bundles is a basket of five cryptocurrencies supported on Coinbase and purchased in proportion to their market capitalization in U.S. dollars.

While Coinbase has not set up a maximum purchase size for a Bundle, the exchange limits daily purchase amounts on a per-customer basis.

Once a customer has bought a Bundle, each type of virtual currency will be stored in their Coinbase wallet and can be bought, sold, sent or received as an individual asset.

Along with the Coinbase Bundle, the exchange will now host informational asset pages about the top 50 digital currencies in terms of market capitalization, in addition to a “Coinbase Learn” section aimed at educating newcomers to cryptocurrency trading.

Recently, Coinbase announced a new process that will allow it to list more digital assets faster.

Coinbase has reportedly been in discussions with the blockchain working group of asset management giant BlackRock.
