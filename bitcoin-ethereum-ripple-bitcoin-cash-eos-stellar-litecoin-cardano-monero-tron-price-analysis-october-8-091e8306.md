## BTC/USD

There is hardly any activity in Bitcoin as it continues to trade in a tight range on low volumes.

## BCH/USD

Bitcoin Cash has held the support of the moving averages for the past five days and is currently trying to bounce off it.

On the downside, a break down of the triangle can sink the EOS/USD pair to the critical support of $4.493, with a minor support at $5.

## XLM/USD

Stellar has been trading in a tight range between the 20-day EMA and $0.24987525 for the past five days.

A breakout and close above the overhead resistance of $70 is likely to start a new uptrend that can propel the LTC/USD pair to the next level of $94.

If the bulls fail to break out of the overhead resistance, the ADA/USD pair might remain range bound for a few more days.

Traders can protect the long positions in the XMR/USD pair with a stop loss at $100.
