U.S. international law firm Perkins Coie (PC) announced it had hired a former counsel for the country’s commodities regulator to work in its blockchain practice in a press release Nov. 6.

Kari Larsen, who previously worked at the Division of Enforcement of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), will now be based at PC’s Blockchain Technology & Digital Currency industry group.

The group originally formed in 2013, with PC keen to gain an understanding of the complex legal landscape which continues to evolve around cryptocurrency and related tokens in the U.S.

“I’m confident that Kari has a true understanding of the impact that blockchain and crypto will have on our industry,” Molly Moynihan, co-chair of the firm’s investment management practice and member of the firm’s management committee commented in the release, adding:

“Her extensive experience representing clients in a wide range of commodity and transactional matters, and regularly providing counsel on global matters related to U.S., U.K. and E.U. commodity laws and regulations, will be a significant advantage to our national practice.”

The move comes as legal advice concerning cryptocurrency handling remains highly sought-after in the weeks leading up to the emergence of fresh offerings targeting institutional investors.

As Cointelegraph reported, Dec. 12 should see the launch of the Intercontinental Exchange’s Bakkt platform, which will offer one-day physical Bitcoin futures.

Earlier this week, the U.S. Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) noted that their BTC futures offering hit record volatility lows in October.

The path to regulatory certainty for Bakkt is complex, commentators have noted this week, some seeing the launch as a crucible for what is possible under the current U.S. climate.
