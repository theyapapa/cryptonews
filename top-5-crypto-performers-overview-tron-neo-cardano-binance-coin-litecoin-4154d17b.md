# Top 5 Crypto Performers Overview: Tron, Neo, Cardano, Binance Coin, Litecoin ...

###### 2019-01-13 12:01

After a strong start in 2019, the crypto markets have witnessed sharp selling that dragged the prices down by about 10 percent on Jan. 10.

## TRX/USD

Tron was the best performer in the past week, as it bucked the trend and stayed comfortably in the green.

After trading close to $0.011 for about five weeks, the bulls staged a smart recovery that pushed the price above the resistance of the range at $0.02815521.

Currently, both moving averages are flat and the RSI is also close to 50 levels, which suggests that range bound action might continue for a few more days.

However, as the price action inside the range can be volatile, traders should keep their positions small.

We expect the price to remain stuck in the range for a few more weeks, before it breaks out or breaks down.

If the price remains stuck inside the channel, buying can be done close to the support line of the channel and profits can be booked closer to the resistance line of the channel.
