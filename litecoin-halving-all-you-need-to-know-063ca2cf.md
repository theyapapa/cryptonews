# Litecoin Halving: All You Need to Know Before the Day ...

###### 2019-08-04 06:08

With just one day to go until Litecoin’s (LTC) next halving event, Cointelegraph sets out all you need to know about the cryptocurrency’s reduction in block rewards.

Lee told Australian crypto news site Mickey that halving the block rewards by 50% always has an impact on the Litecoin mining ecosystem:

“When the mining rewards get cut in half, some miners will not be profitable and they will shut off their machine.

After Litecoin’s 2015 halving, the coin peaked in July of that year before losing nearly 50% of its value by the time of the reward reduction, culminating in a decrease of 75% in the aftermath, Mickey reports.

Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at ThinkMarketsFX, told Cointelegraph via email that reducing block rewards for miners is an effective filtering process and agreed that the effect on the price is usually positive:

“Reducing the incentive for miners is good for LTC because only serious people will remain in the space.

Renowned crypto trader and technical analyst Crypto Rand also agreed in email conversations with Cointelegraph that the halving event has already been priced in:

“I don't think the halving event will have much impact on Litecoin price, it's already priced in since one month I would say.

For Greenspan, the comparison is sound, although he warned that results will not be identical:

“The market has matured a lot since the last Bitcoin and Litecoin halvings.

Crypto Rand is not so sure, however, stating that investor understanding and even awareness of Litecoin juxtaposed to Bitcoin is incomparable:

“I don't think LTC halving can work as test for Bitcoin, I would say 95% of the traders/investors are not aware of the halving on LTC or they don't know what means.
