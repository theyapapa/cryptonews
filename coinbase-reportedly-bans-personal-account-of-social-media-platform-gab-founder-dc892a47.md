# Coinbase Reportedly Bans Personal Account of Social Media Platform Gab Founder ...

###### 2019-01-05 11:01

The personal Coinbase merchant account of Andrew Torba, social media platform Gab’s founder, has been terminated, the official Gab.com account tweeted on Jan. 4.

As blockchain blog Breaker reported earlier, Gab’s business account on Coinbase was allegedly closed in December.

The news source put forward that a possible reason why it is hard for Gab to obtain a payment processor is its reputation for being the social network for people banned from mainstream platforms for hate speech.

In October, the New York Times mentioned Gab as a social network used by the shooter in Pittsburgh to post a final message before he attacked a synagogue.

Gab describes itself on its website as a “social network that champions free speech, individual liberty and the free flow of information online.

In December 2017, WikiLeaks’ founder, Julian Assange, had urged donors to contribute to the online publication by using cryptocurrencies in order to skirt the so-dubbed financial blockade by national governments.

This past December, major American magazine Time reported about Bitcoin’s liberating potential, suggesting that it can ensure economic flow outside of oppressive government’s reach.
