Estonia-based cryptocurrency and tokenized stock exchange DX.Exchange has reportedly fixed a critical vulnerability that leaked sensitive user data.

Technology news website Ars Technica reported on the security leak Jan. 9, citing an anonymous trader who conducted a security analysis of DX.Exchange.

According to Ars Technica’s article, a trader, who wished to remain anonymous due to legal concerns, noticed that the exchange was sending sensitive data of other users to their browser.

After examining the data, the trader has reportedly found that the data included other users’ authentication tokens and password reset links:

“I have about 100 collected \[authentication\] tokens over 30 minutes, \[...\] if you wanted to criminalize this, it would be super easy.”

According to Ars Technica, the trader has explained that the tokens could grant access to their associated accounts, as long as the user hasn’t manually logged out after the token was leaked.

Ars Technica itself has reportedly checked and confirmed the presence of the vulnerabilities discovered by the trader, obtaining what it described as a large number of authentication tokens through the publicly available programming interface.

However, the company declined to comment on its intentions to warn the users about the now-patched vulnerability:

“Ars sent a response asking if DX.Exchange planned to reset all user tokens or passwords and to notify users that a leak exposed their names and email addresses.
