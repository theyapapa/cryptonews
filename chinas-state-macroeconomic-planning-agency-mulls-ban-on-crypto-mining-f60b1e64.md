# China’s State Macroeconomic Planning Agency Mulls Ban on Crypto Mining ...

China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), a state planning agency charged with spearheading macroeconomic policies, has revealed it is considering the elimination of crypto mining in the country.

The NDRC has reportedly now included crypto mining as part of its draft for a revised list of industrial activities the agency intends to curtail.

With the draft list reportedly open to public feedback since yesterday, April 8, the NDRC has reportedly not set a proposed target date for eradicating crypto mining activities, stipulating instead that the industry should be phased out with immediate effect.

Reuters cites state-owned newspaper the Securities Times as today reporting that the NDRC’s draft list “distinctly reflects the attitude of the country’s industrial policy” towards the cryptocurrency industry.

Since the People’s Bank of China (PBoC)’s historic ban on initial coin offerings (ICOs) in September 2017, the Chinese state has made a series of faltering moves to attempt to cut the country’s crypto mining titans down to size.

Nonetheless, mining has to date not yet been prohibited outright, with industry giants such as Beijing-born Bitmain operating both in the country and overseas.

In late March, Bitmain announced its plans to set up 200,000 units of mining equipment in China to benefit from the country’s low-cost hydroelectric power, even as it contracted its overseas operations.
