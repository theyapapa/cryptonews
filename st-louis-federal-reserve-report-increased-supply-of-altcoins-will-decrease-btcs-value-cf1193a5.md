# St. Louis Federal Reserve Report: Increased Supply of Altcoins Will Decrease BTC’s Value ...

###### 2019-01-12 07:01

The creation of competing altcoins is likely to place downward pressure on the prices of all cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC).

The report cites two perspectives: Bitcoin bulls’ belief that the capped supply and increased demand will increase BTC’s price, and the bears’ belief that its price will fall to zero.

According to the research, the United States dollar price of BTC will also depend on its exchange rate relative to altcoins.

The report explains that the bulls expect Bitcoin to appreciate relative to altcoins, or to keep its market capital relative to the global crypto market cap constant.

According to the researchers, the chart suggests that the increasing supply of altcoins keeps Bitcoin’s price and market cap depressed.

Still, according to the report, Bitcoin has a fundamental value that will prevent its price from falling to zero that derives from demand for its permissionless access and decentralized database.

The report concludes:

“While Bitcoin's price is not likely to fall to zero, the prospect of a flood of Altcoin competing with Bitcoin in the wealth portfolios of investors is likely to place significant downward pressure on the purchasing power of all cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin.”
