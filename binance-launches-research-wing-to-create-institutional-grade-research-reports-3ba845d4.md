The largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, has launched an analysis division to conduct “institutional-grade” research reports, according to an announcement published Nov. 8.

Binance’s new analysis division, Binance Research, is set to prepare institutional-grade research reports with the objective of increasing transparency and improve the quality of information within the cryptocurrency space.

Binance Research is not the first project from the exchange beyond its original mandate.

Founded in China in 2014, Binance is now the world’s largest digital exchange in terms of adjusted daily trading volume, which is around $796 million at press time, according to CoinMarketCap.

Binance has been gradually expanding its trading activities to other countries, recently announcing the launch of its fiat-to-crypto exchange in Uganda, enabling users to buy two major cryptocurrencies — BTC and ETH — with the local fiat currency of Ugandan shillings.

Also that month, Binance signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Malta Stock Exchange’s fintech and digital asset subsidiary, MSX PLC, to launch a trading platform.

In August, Binance LCX, a joint venture between Binance and Liechtenstein Cryptoassets Exchange (LCX), announced the launch of a fiat-to-crypto exchange in Lichtenstein.
