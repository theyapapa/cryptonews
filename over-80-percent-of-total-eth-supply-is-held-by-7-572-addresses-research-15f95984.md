Over 80 percent of the total circulating supply of Ethereum (ETH) is held by 7,572 addresses, claims a report released by digital asset research company Delphi Digital on March 7.

More precisely, the data contained in the report claim that over 80 percent of the total supply of ETH coins are held by addresses with a balance higher than 1,000 ETH.

In the same document, the company also claims that the price of ETH has dropped an average of 19 percent after each of the past five hard forks, over the following 30 days.

Still, the most recent hard fork before last month’s Constantinople and St. Petersburg updates actually saw the price of ETH decrease by under one percent, which the report suggests is in part due to the decrease in block rewards from 5 ETH to 3 ETH.

The researchers also pointed out that as of March 3, over 2.3 million Ethereum (about 2 percent of the total supply) was present in decentralized finance apps.

The report’s author, Delphi Digital, positions itself as a company aiming to produce unbiased content concerning digital assets and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and to provide analysis services to institutional clients.

Another recent report on Ethereum, this time by crypto asset management firm Electric Capital, claimed that Ethereum has the most developers working on its base protocol of all cryptocurrencies, not counting community project developers.
