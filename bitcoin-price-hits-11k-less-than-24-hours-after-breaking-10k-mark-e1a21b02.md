June 22 — bitcoin (BTC) has crossed the $11,000 line for the first time since March last year today.

Yesterday, on June 21, professional trader Peter Brandt tweeted that bitcoin’s price is currently taking aim at $100,000 target.

In his tweet, Brandt noted that bitcoin is on its fourth parabolic growth phase and is a market like no other:

“Bitcoin takes aim at $100,000 target.

Attached to the tweet, Brandt also published a table containing data about the price growth of bitcoin.

In late May, the co-founder of blockchain investment firm Kenetic predicted that the price of bitcoin will rally as high as $30,000 by the end of this year.

Earlier this month, the founder and CEO of Digital Currency Group argued that it “looks like, perhaps, we are coming out of a crypto winter and we’ve entered a crypto spring,” in an interview with Bloomberg.

However, in an interview with Cointelegraph the same week, another industry commentator — ex-Wall Street executive and current blockchain researcher Tone Vays expressed skepticism about the fact that crypto winter is over.
