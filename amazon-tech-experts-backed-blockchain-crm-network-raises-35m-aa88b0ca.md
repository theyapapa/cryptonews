Cere Network, a San Francisco-based blockchain customer relationship management (CRM) startup, has completed a $3.5 million funding round.

The seed round involved major global blockchain investors, including Binance Labs, a venture arm of Binance, the second biggest crypto exchange by trading volumes to date.

Alongside with the investment, Cere Network announced the launch of a new office in New York, as well as plans to set up the Cere Network Innovation Factory in Berlin during Berlin Blockchain Week, which will be held between Aug. 18 and Aug. 29.

## One of the most rapidly evolving industries

Founded by Silicon Valley veterans with tech expertise from Amazon, Twitch and Bebo, Cere Network plans to disrupt the rapidly developing CRM industry.

By applying blockchain technology to CRM, Cere Network intends to expand the limited pool of data shared in CRM, also ensuring privacy and security of data, the press release notes.

Feng Xiao, general partner at China-based $50 million crypto fund Fenbushi Capital, stressed Cere Networkâ€™s potential to address interoperability issues across multiple industries.

Earlier in July, Cointelegraph reported on Cere Network receiving a strategic funding from Binance Labs, Arrington XRP Capital and NEO Global Capital.
