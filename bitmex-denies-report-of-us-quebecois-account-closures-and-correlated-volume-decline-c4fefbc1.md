# BitMEX Denies Report of US, Québecois Account Closures and Correlated Volume Decline ...

###### 2019-01-16 06:01

Major crypto derivatives trading platform BitMEX says there are major inaccuracies in a recent media report that alleged the exchange was closing United States and Québec residents’ accounts due to a regulatory crackdown.

In detailed comments to CT Japan, BitMEX claimed there were as many as six major mistakes in the report, which was published on Jan. 15 by Hong Kong-based English-language newspaper South China Morning Post (SCMP).

SCMP had further alleged that BitMEX was stepping up restrictions on U.S. accounts in light of escalating enforcement actions from the country’s securities regulator.

The report had claimed that while Asia accounts for the lion’s share of BitMEX trading volumes, the U.S. had nonetheless been its other major market, according to unnamed insider sources.

BitMEX refuted these claims, telling CT Japan that the platform has “banned all US Traders since 2015 and has been proactively closing accounts since guidance was obtained by US regulators, in particular the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).”

BitMEX did not specifically comment on the AMF’s recent alleged actions and subsequent Québecois account closures, but pointed CT Japan to the platform’s terms of service, which it said have always had the following wording in place, based on the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) lists from the U.S. Department of Treasury :

“Residents of the United States of America or Québec (Canada) are prohibited from holding positions or entering into contracts at BitMEX.

BitMEX emphasized its legal incorporation in the Seychelles, not Hong Kong, in comment to CT Japan, as the SCMP report had at various points described its as a Hong Kong-based company, elsewhere noting its Seychelles registration.
