United States-based payments firm Square’s Cash App has reportedly blocked the personal account of the founder of controversial social media site Gab, according to a tweet from Gab Jan. 8.

The move was reported just after Gab announced that the firm had sent an email to its user base promoting Cash App and Bitcoin (BTC).

In a tweet today, Gab announced that it has sent over 850,000 emails to its users, introducing them to “free speech money: Bitcoin.”

The screenshot of the firm’s email generally describes alleged censorship measures that have been taken against “influential alternative media personalities and companies,” but also calls on users to use BTC as a “censorship-resistant free speech money and payment processing.”

Further in the letter, Gab also directly recommends and evidently links to Square’s Cash App for transactions with BTC.

In a tweet several minutes later, Gab reported that Cash App had blocked the personal account of Gab’s founder, Andrew Torba.

On Jan. 6, Gab announced it had started using Cash App to transact and receive BTC donations after its corporate account on major U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase was reportedly closed.
