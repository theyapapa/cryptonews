# Japanese Court Acquits Man Accused of Cryptojacking ...

A Japanese court has acquitted a man who was accused of illicitly mining cryptocurrency by using the computing power of visitors to his website, Japan Today reported on March 27.

The program allows the user to take advantage of website visitors’ spare computing power to mine cryptocurrencies — a practice known as cryptojacking.

At the same, prosecutors pursued a fine of 100,000 yen ($904), arguing that the man was running the program without asking permission from visitors.

They also argued that the program increased visitors’ electricity consumption.

As reported last December, a report by cyber security firm McAfee Labs revealed that cryptojacking malware activity rose by over 4,000 percent in 2018.

Today, Cointelegraph reported that Ukraine’s Cyber Police arrested a 32-year-old man from the Bukovina region who had allegedly placed cryptojacking software on a number of educational websites that he created and administered.

The police stated that the installed malware on the websites was deploying visitors’ devices’ CPU and GPU power to illegally mine cryptocurrencies.
