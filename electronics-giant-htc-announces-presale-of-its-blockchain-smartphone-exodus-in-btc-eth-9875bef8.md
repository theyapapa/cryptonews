Taiwanese electronics company HTC has announced the presale of its widely-discussed blockchain smartphone, Exodus 1, the product’s official Twitter account reveals Oct. 23.

According to the HTC Exodus website, “early access” to the phone can currently only be purchased via Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH), and is available to 34 regions, including the U.S., U.K. and Hong Kong.

At press time, pre-orders for the Exodus 1 are listed at around $960 (0.15 BTC or 4.78 ETH), with shipping date stated as December 2018.

The company then promised Exodus 1 would support “multiple blockchain protocols,” such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Lightning Network (LN), and Dfinity network, as well as boast a universal cryptocurrency wallet.

In July, HTC confirmed its plans to install a native crypto wallet inside its phone.

However, the current Exodus 1 is not exactly what HTC had promised earlier, as U.S. tech journal The Verge points out.

When announced in May, as The Verge reports, HTC’s “decentralized chief officer” Phil Chen had said that each Exodus phone would function as a “node” to facilitate bitcoin trading.
