Odyssey, the mainnet for the blockchain-based platform TRON, will be upgraded to version 3.6 soon, according to an official blog post by the TRON Foundation on June 18.

The TRON network aims to be a platform for creating entertainment-focused decentralized applications (DApps).

As stated in the post, developers can create DApps on both the TRON protocol as well as the Tron Virtual Machine.

Odyssey version 3.6 will reportedly contain new features designed to make DApp creation easier, as well as provide network protection from bad actors.

The post also notes that the TRON public chain can perform tens of thousands of transactions per second (TPS).

According to its website, TRON consistently performs 2,000 transactions per second, dwarfing a purported Ethereum (ETH) network TPS of 25 and a Bitcoin (BTC) network TPS of 3-6.

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Tron CEO Justin Sun advertised Odyssey version 3.1 as having superior speed to BTC and ETH.
