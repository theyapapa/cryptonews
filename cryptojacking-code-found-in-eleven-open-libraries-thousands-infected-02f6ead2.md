A Cryptojacking code was found in 11 open-source code libraries written in Ruby, which have been downloaded thousands of times.

Industry news outlet Decrypt reported on Aug. 21 that cryptojacking code has been added to 11 open-source Ruby libraries distributed on the RubyGems platform.

Per the report, the infected libraries were downloaded over three and a half thousand times.

The malicious code was first noticed by a GitHub user, who posted about the issue on Aug. 19.

He pointed out that, when executed, the library downloaded additional code from text hosting service Pastebin, which then triggered the malicious mining.

## A seemingly targeted attack

Five of the libraries infected were cryptocurrency-specific, with names like doge-coin, bitcoin\_vanity, coin\_base and blockchain\_wallet.

The last two were reportedly the most downloaded, with coin\_base counting 424 downloads and blockchain\_wallet 423.
