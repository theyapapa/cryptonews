# Japan: Bitcoin Surpasses XRP in Yen-Denominated Crypto Holdings ...

###### 2019-09-10 05:09

Fresh data from the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association (JVCEA) has revealed that as of April 2019, the value of yen-denominated Bitcoin (BTC) holdings has outstripped those in XRP on domestic exchanges.

As Cointelegraph Japan reported on Sept. 10, the surge in the value of exchanges’ Bitcoin holdings coincides with the beginning of Bitcoin’s 2019 bullish uptrend, which saw the top cryptocurrency hit close to $14,000 by late June.

## Bitcoin holdings soar in value amid stagnating altcoin market

The JVCEA is a self-regulatory crypto exchange association that formed in March 2018 in order to help establish industry-wide investor protection standards.

As Cointelegraph Japan notes, back in December 2018, the value of yen-denominated XRP holdings had been higher than that of Bitcoin holdings — despite Bitcoin’s larger market capitalization globally.

The value of yen-denominated Bitcoin holdings hit a peak in June 2019, while the peak measured in terms of total accumulated Bitcoin was reported in April, at 156,651 BTC.
