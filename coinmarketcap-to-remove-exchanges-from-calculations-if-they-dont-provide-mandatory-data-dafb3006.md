Crypto market cap tracker CoinMarketCap (CMC) will remove exchanges from its calculations if they fail to provide mandatory data by June, the firm wrote in its sixth anniversary blog post on May 1.

As such, CMC has announced a brand new alliance called the Data Accountability & Transparency Alliance (DATA) in order to provide “greater transparency, accountability, and disclosure from projects in the crypto space.”

A broad number of exchanges have already joined the new alliance, including Binance, Bittrex, OKEx, Huobi, Liquid, UpBit, IDEX, OceanEX, Gate.io, KuCoin, HitBTC and Bitfinex, with more partners expected in the future, the announcement states.

As a part of its transparency initiative, CoinMarketCap will also now require all the crypto exchanges to provide mandatory API data that includes their live trading data and live order book data.

Stressing that the condition will be mandatory, CMC wrote that any exchange that does not provide this mandatory data will be not be included in the price and adjusted volume calculations on the site.

The exchanges now have a 45-day grace period to send the required data, while changes will come into effect on June 14, 2019, CoinMarketCap noted.

Apart from the DATA alliance announcement, CMC also introduced new features such as CoinMarketCap Block Explorers, CoinMarketCap Shop, API Revised Plans and CoinMarketCap Mobile Apps.
