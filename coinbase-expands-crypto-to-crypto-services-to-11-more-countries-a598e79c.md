Major American cryptocurrency exchange and wallet provider Coinbase has expanded its crypto-to-crypto trading to more countries, according to a blog post published on April 17.

Coinbase and its professional trading platform Coinbase Pro have introduced crypto-to-crypto conversions and trading to 11 more countries in Latin America and Southeast Asia.

Coinbase customers in the aforementioned countries can now store, trade, send, and receive cryptocurrencies.

Coinbase explains:

â€œThis could take the form of decentralized versions of traditional financial services like lending or micropayments or truly novel crypto applications that no one has even thought of yet.

Recently, Coinbase introduced several new developments, including adding support for EOS (EOS), Augur (REP) and Maker (MKR) and expanding into cross-border payments.

Earlier in April, Coinbase also launched Coinbase Card with Visa, which enables its United Kingdom-based customers to pay in-store and online with cryptocurrency.

The new service allows Coinbase to instantly convert customers' cryptocurrency funds into fiat currency in order to complete the purchase.
