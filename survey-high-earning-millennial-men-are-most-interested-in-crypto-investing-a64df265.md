The survey found a solid level of awareness of digital currencies, with more than 75 percent of respondents claiming that they “feel” they know what cryptocurrency is, while the remaining 20 percent suppose they “sort of” know what is happening in the crypto field.

In regards to explaining to others what crypto is, 62 percent of the survey participants said they are able to keep up a discussion about cryptocurrencies.

When asked their opinion on investment in crypto, almost 80 percent of respondents answered that they consider investing in crypto as a positive form of risk-taking.

Recent research has found that of all the generations, millennials show the most interest in crypto investing.
