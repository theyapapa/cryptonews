# Think Crypto’s Challenges Are Unique? It’s Just History Repeating Itself ...

Creating an asset which represents something else is something that hundreds of utility coins in the crypto world do today.

## Paper currency

At roughly the same time, paper currency was beginning to come along in leaps and bounds, but they did cause immense amounts of price volatility.

## Making notes notable

With money changing hands in ever larger quantities, it became important for bank notes to be trusted and recognized internationally.

Many crypto organizations, which do not rely on central banks, are now underwriting their digital currencies with precious metals – and some banks are even making a cautious foray into the world of crypto.

The huge global downturn 10 years ago, which saw several financial institutions collapse, could be regarded as the straw that broke the camel’s back – with high fees, slow speeds, a lack of transparency and the exclusion of hundreds of millions of people without a bank account leading some to realize that a new approach was needed.

Just like cowrie shells had to gain traction all those millennia ago, cryptocurrencies and blockchain are now hoping to deliver a seismic change in money transfers – and economies as we know them.

Slow adoption, price volatility, underwriting currencies with gold and banks slow to embrace new technology.
