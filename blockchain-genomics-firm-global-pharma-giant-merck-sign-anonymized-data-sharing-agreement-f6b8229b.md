# Blockchain Genomics Firm, Global Pharma Giant Merck Sign Anonymized Data Sharing Agreement ...

###### 2019-06-11 09:06

Blockchain firm Nebula Genomics has announced a collaboration with EMD Serono, the North American biopharmaceutical business of Merck KGaA — the world’s oldest operating pharmaceutical firm.

The platform leverages blockchain technology in a bid to incentivize genomic data generation and sharing, and to lower the costs of genome-sequencing while preserving privacy and individuals’ control over their unique and sensitive data.

In its collaboration with EDM Serono, Nebula will provide the firm with access to its network of anonymized genomic data in order to support the research and development of new medicines.

In an accompanying blog post shared with Cointelegraph, Nebula outlined that its agreement with EDM Serono represents its first attempt to realize a model of sponsored genome sequencing.

The press release notes that the creation and analysis of large genomic datasets holds a transformative potential for healthcare and biomedical research, but that slow data generation, data fragmentation and inefficient consent management all currently pose obstacles to realizing this potential.

As reported last week, major pharmaceutical firm Boehringer Ingelheim has recently partnered with blockchain healthcare platform Solve.Care to build a blockchain- and digital asset-powered network for the trusted sharing of data about patients with diabetes.

A Cointelegraph in-depth report last fall covered Nebula Genomics and other projects that are working on blockchain solutions that aim to innovate the ownership and circulation models for highly sensitive and scientifically valuable genomic data.
