# Binance Freezes Funds With Suspected Money Laundering Links From Controversial Exchange WEX ...

###### 2018-10-31 13:10

Troubled cryptocurrency exchange WEX.nz has seen its funds frozen by fellow exchange Binance after users claimed the exchange was involved in money laundering, CEO Changpeng Zhao confirmed on social media Oct. 29.

In response to an alert by an online trader known as John James on Twitter, Zhao said Binance had quarantined funds sent from wallets associated with WEX.

We will work with LE \[law enforcement\],” Zhao wrote in the tweet.

But we will do what we can,” Zhao continued in his tweet Monday.

He added that laundered funds would “soon” use decentralized exchanges to avoid freezes traditional platforms are able to instigate.

The controversy caps an increasingly precarious situation at Russian-based WEX, which owner Dmitrii Vasilev billed as a follow-on to the defunct BTC-e when it took over its ecosystem last year.

In July, WEX evidently halted withdrawals of funds altogether, though claiming to have completed scheduled maintenance, leading to claims from users in social media that the exchange was a “scam.”
