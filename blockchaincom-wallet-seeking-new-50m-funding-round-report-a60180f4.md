The sources added that Sam Harrison, who joined the company in 2018 to co-found its Blockchain Ventures spin-off, is in charge of proceedings.

Blockchain has yet to confirm the reports, which come on the back of previous round in March this year.

More broadly, Blockchain has sought to diversify its crypto industry presence away from just Bitcoin (BTC), a move which has earned it criticism.

These have included a $125 million giveaway involving altcoin Stellar (XLM) last November, and resisting calls to implement Segregated Witness (SegWit) for Bitcoin users, something which would reduce the cost of sending transactions from its wallet.

Last month, BashCo, the Reddit user in charge of moderating the r/Bitcoin subreddit, publicly criticized Blockchain for failing to offer SegWit.
