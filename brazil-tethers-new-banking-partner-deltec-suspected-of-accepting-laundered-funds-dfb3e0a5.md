Brazilian law enforcement has solicited the help of Bahamian authorities to investigate suspicious transactions to Deltec Bank & Trust – the recently-announced new banking partner of controversial stablecoin Tether (USDT) – major Brazilian newspaper O Globo reports Nov. 6.

As per the report, the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office in São Paulo is on the trail of Paulo Vieira de Souza, a former director of the São Paulo road infrastructure company DERSA.

As explained by O Globo, the head of DERSA allegedly transferred a total of 25 million Swiss francs (approximately $25 million) to the accounts of Panama-based offshore company Nantes Group, which were apparently operated by a private Swiss bank Bordier & Cie. De Souza himself appeared as a beneficiary of those accounts.

In February 2017, the amount was reportedly transferred to accounts in Deltec Bank & Trust, with headquarters in Bahamian capital Nassau — the very same bank that recently partnered with the team behind controversial USD-backed stablecoin Tether.

According to O Globo, Brazilian prosecutors are now waiting for a response from Bahamas officials to learn if the mentioned amount actually found its way to Deltec Bank & Trust.

Tether announced its partnership with Deltec Bank & Trust Ltd. shortly after reportedly parting ways with Puerto Rico’s Noble Bank International.

Noble Bank had also allegedly held accounts for major crypto exchange Bitfinex, who shares a CEO with Tether.
