The world’s largest diamond mining firm, Russia’s Alrosa, has joined the pilot of fellow industry giant De Beers’ diamond supply chain blockchain platform “Tracr,” mining industry news outlet Mining Weekly reports Oct. 29.

Alrosa is reported to be the world’s largest producer of raw diamonds in carat terms; together with De Beers, the two firms produce around half of the world’s supply.

Tracr, whose pilot was first announced in January, aims to improve transparency and consumer trust across the diamond value chain from mine to retail.

The Tracr blockchain initiative is reportedly designed to complement existing regulations and schemes that already function to foster industry confidence in diamonds’ provenance and quality, such as the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme, World Diamond Council System of Warranties, and Responsible Jewellery Council Code of Practices.

De Beers’ first successfully implemented the blockchain solution to track 100 high-value diamonds this May.

That same month, Signet Jewelers, the world’s largest diamond jewelry retailer, also joined the pilot Tracr initiative.

Also in May, Alrosa partnered with KGK Diamonds to work with blockchain startup D1 Mint to tokenize diamonds.
