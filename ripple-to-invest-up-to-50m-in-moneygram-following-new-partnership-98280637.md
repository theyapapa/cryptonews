Major money transmission network MoneyGram has entered into a strategic partnership with blockchain-based payments firm Ripple, according to a press release on June 17.

As part of the agreement, MoneyGram will be able to draw up to $50 million dollars from Ripple in exchange for equity.

MoneyGram will purportedly use Ripple’s xRapid liquidity product, which allows money to be sent in one currency and instantly settled in the destination currency.

In using Ripple’s XRP token for such transfers, xRapid can purportedly settle such transactions faster than with fiat currencies or other major digital assets.

MoneyGram Chairman and CEO Alex Holmes said:

“Through Ripple’s xRapid product, we will have the ability to instantly settle funds from U.S. dollars to destination currencies on a 24/7 basis, which has the potential to revolutionize our operations and dramatically streamline our global liquidity management.”

In March, India’s Federal Bank (IFB), a commercial private bank, partnered with Ripple to use its network for cross-border remittances.

The partnership was part of an initiative to apply new technologies to IFB’s remittances network, having also launched two platforms in the United Arab Emirates for making payments to India.
