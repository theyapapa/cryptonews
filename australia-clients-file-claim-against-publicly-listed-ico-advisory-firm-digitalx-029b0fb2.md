###### 2018-09-28 09:09

Crypto firm DigitalX Ltd. has been served with an Originating Application and Statement of Claim.

The claim was filed by a group of DigitalX’s clients in Australia’s Federal Court, according to an official announcement published September 28.

DigitalX describes itself as a publicly-listed firm that offers Initial Coin Offering (ICO) advisory services, blockchain consulting services and blockchain-related software development.

In its announcement today, the firm explains that the claim has been filed by clients in relation to an ICO investment for which DigitalX served as an advisor.

The firm says that while its legal advisors are reviewing and examining the claims:

“\[DigitalX\] denies any claim of wrongdoing and, for reasons that will become apparent as the matter progresses, believes it has strong grounds to defend any claims brought forward by these applicants.

As of press time, DigitalX share prices are at A$0.083 ($0.06), down 11.7 percent on the day, according to data from the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX).

As reported earlier this month, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), issued a warning on “misleading” ICOs and crypto-asset funds targeted at retail investors.
