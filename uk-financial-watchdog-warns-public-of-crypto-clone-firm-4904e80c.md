# UK Financial Watchdog Warns Public of Crypto Clone Firm ...

###### 2019-05-24 20:05

The primary financial regulator of the United Kingdom, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), warned that ICAP Crypto is a clone firm in a public announcement on May 24.

According to the report, ICAP Crypto is a clone firm of ICAP Europe Limited.

Clone firms are a type of scam in which the scammers use information from legitimate firms in an attempt to convince targets that they are genuine.

In this case, ICAP Europe Limited is a legitimate firm that is authorized by the FCA, and its details are being propagated in scams using the similarly-named ICAP Crypto “firm” which is neither authorized nor registered by the FCA.

In 2018, the FCA issued warnings over at least two nominally crypto-related clone firms.

The second clone, Good Crypto, ran its scam by misrepresenting some of the registration information of the legitimate firm Arup Corporate Finance as its own.

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the FCA stated this week that crypto and forex investors in the U.K. were scammed out of over $34 million from 2018–2019.
