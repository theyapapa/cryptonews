# Blockchain Payments’ Mass Adoption Is 3-5 Years Away, Says BitPay CEO ...

The CEO of crypto merchant platform BitPay Stephen Pair stated that speculation on future adoption drives Bitcoin’s (BTC) price more than “actual utility,” in an interview on CNBC Dec. 13.

Speaking on the reasons behind Bitcoin’s current value, compared to its historic price highs, Pair told reporters:

“A very big component of the \[Bitcoin’s\] price is certainly speculation.

When asked about a Bitcoin ETF’s potential to stimulate a price rally, Pair argued that “not just ETF adoption or ETF launches” could be catalysts for price movement, but that “adoption will push the prices higher,” adding optimistically:

“I do think we’ll see those kinds of prices at some point in the future, if history is any guide.”

Answering a question about blockchain-based currencies’ use in daily transactions, the BitPay CEO told CNBC that he expects such adoption to occur on a mass scale in under half a decade, stating that:

“I used to say 10 years, but now I think it’s more like 3-5 years until you can go into a restaurant, a retail establishment, and just everybody’s going to expect that that store will be able to accept a blockchain payment.”

Pair then further noted that he was not just referring to “Bitcoin or the various tokens that we see today \[but\] also about issuing dollars on a blockchain or euros on a blockchain.”

As Cointelegraph recently reported earlier this month, Peirce said that an approval “could be 20 years from now” or “tomorrow,” urging the crypto community to not “ hold \[its\] breath.”

A Bloomberg analysis of the study claims that the increase in crypto’s user base, despite prices declining, “could signal that an eventual recovery could be coming.”
