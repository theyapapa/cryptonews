The Department of Federal Revenue of Brazil (RFB), which administers tax collection in the country, is seeking to receive monthly reports on crypto assets operations, according to a document released by the RFB Tuesday, Oct. 30.

In the paper, the RFB has announced that Brazil-based crypto exchanges are now obliged to send them detailed reports on all crypto-related operations on monthly basis.

Moreover, both legal entities and individuals residing in Brazil are now obliged to report all the transactions they have carried out at foreign crypto exchanges if they surpass $10,000 Brazilian reals ($2,700) per month.

According to the RFB, the number of crypto exchange clients has already exceeded the number of users registered at B3 — the Brazilian stock exchange based in Sao Paulo.

In its turn, the daily volume of transactions conducted by five major Brazilian crypto exchanges surpasses 8.3 million reals (around $2.2 million).

CADE has sent a questionnaire to ten Brazilian crypto exchanges targeted by the bank’s decision.

In late October, the Federal District Court of Brazil forced major banks Banco do Brasil and Santander Brasil to reopen the accounts for local crypto exchange Bitcoin Max.
