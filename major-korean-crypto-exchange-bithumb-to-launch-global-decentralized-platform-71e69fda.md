###### 2018-10-04 13:10

South Korean crypto exchange Bithumb, currently the world’s sixth largest by daily traded volume, will open a global decentralized crypto exchange, Business Korea reports Oct. 4.

Bithumb has partnered with blockchain firm One Root Network (RNT), which has developed an Ethereum (ETH)-based decentralized token transaction protocol dubbed “R1” and already operates a decentralized exchange (DEX).

Business Korea cites a Bithumb official as saying that the partnership centers on technical support, clarifying that “Bithumb DEX will be operated by its overseas subsidiary.

As RNT has outlined, its project aims to enable traffic holders such as Bithumb to build their own decentralized platforms, and share transaction data and liquidity with other R1 protocol users as part of a wider ecosystem.

Business Korea further cites an unnamed industry source as saying that the partnership represents a global expansion strategy by the Korean exchange:

“Bithumb is one of the leading global exchanges in terms of transactions but it is true that most of its users are Korean.

Business Korea notes that rival Korean exchange Upbit has also made a foray into the DEX space through its investment in Allbit.

As reported in August, the world’s largest crypto trading platform Binance has released a simple demo of its own forthcoming decentralized exchange, without yet disclosing an expected launch date.
