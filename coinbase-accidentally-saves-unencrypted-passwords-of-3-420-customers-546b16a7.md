# Coinbase Accidentally Saves Unencrypted Passwords of 3,420 Customers ...

###### 2019-08-16 17:08

Major crypto platform Coinbase has emailed 3,420 Coinbase customers to disclose an accident with customer registration.

Some registration details were apparently stored in clear text on the logs of Coinbase’s internal server, with affected customers now required to change their passwords.

According to the announcement, Coinbase has resolved the root cause of the bug and the platform is confident that stored data was not “improperly accessed, misused, or compromised.”

When users encountered this error, Coinbase would deny their registration but still save their credentials, including username, email address, proposed password and state of residence for United States-based users.

Per the announcement, Coinbase uses Amazon Work Station (AWS) for its internal logging, and it shares data with a few log analysis services.

According to the announcement, Coinbase Custody is now the largest crypto custodian by AUC in the world, with 120 clients spanning 14 different countries.
