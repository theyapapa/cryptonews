# Ethereum Consortium Launches New Enterprise Tools With Input From Microsoft, Intel ...

###### 2019-05-13 11:05

Member-driven blockchain standards organization the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) has released two new specifications aiming to accelerate and enhance blockchain implementation for enterprises.

The EEA, which counts over 500 members, describes itself as a “standards organization whose charter is to develop open, blockchain specifications that drive harmonization and interoperability.”

EEA members include global consulting firm Accenture, banks Santander and JPMorgan Chase, blockchain incubator ConsenSys, Big Four auditor EY, tech giants Intel, Microsoft and IBM and blockchain consortium R3.

One of today’s newly-released specifications is a set of standard application programming interfaces (APIs) — published as the EEA Off-Chain Trusted Compute Specification V1.0 — which support development work with programs for blockchain transactions that demand privacy, oracle services and compute-intensive workloads.

In a statement accompanying the solution’s release, EEA executive director Ron Resnick acknowledged in particular the input of EEA members such as Microsoft, Intel, Banco Santander and ConsenSys.

He noted that many enterprise blockchain use cases demand complex “privacy, security, throughput, and latency” solutions, and thus that:

“Temporarily moving some transactions off-chain for computation elsewhere, and then returning a summary to the main chain is a promising method for achieving such requirements.”

EEA’s parallel new release is the Enterprise Ethereum Client Specification V3, which reportedly simplifies and makes the Client’s permissions systems more flexible.
