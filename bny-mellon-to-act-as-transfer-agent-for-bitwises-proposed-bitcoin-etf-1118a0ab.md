Bank of New York Mellon has been appointed to serve as transfer agent and administrator of Bitwise Asset Management’s proposed Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF).

The amendment also lists major accounting firm Cohen & Company as auditor, while Boston-based legal firm Foreside Fund Services is listed as the Bitcoin ETF’s marketing agent.

## The long road to a Bitcoin ETF

In January 2019, Bitwise filed its proposed rule change to the Securities Act of 1933 to list its Bitcoin ETF on NYSE Arca.

Since its filing, the ETF has experienced a circuitous series of delays from regulators, who are still nervous about the potential for manipulation in cryptocurrency markets and its subsequent effect on a hypothetical Bitcoin ETF.

Most recently, the SEC delayed its decision on the Bitwise ETF to Oct. 13.

In an August interview, he noted that the SEC has been open regarding its concerns about a Bitcoin ETF, which include issues pertaining to proof of custody.

SEC Chairman Jay Clayton recently said that progress is being made vis-a-vis a Bitcoin ETF, but the agency still had pressing concerns that need to be addressed, stating, “There is work left to be done.”
