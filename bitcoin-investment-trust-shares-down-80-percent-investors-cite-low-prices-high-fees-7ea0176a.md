# Bitcoin Investment Trust Shares Down 80 Percent, Investors Cite Low Prices, High Fees ...

The “lone” Bitcoin (BTC) investment trust in the U.S., Grayscale Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), has seen its net asset value hit the lowest point since the BTC price surge of 2017, Bloomberg reported October 2.

GBTC is an open-ended grantor trust, the purpose of which is to track BTC market price.

The drop purportedly follows the fall of the BTC price, which is down nearly 66 percent during the same timeframe.

Some investors attribute part of GBTC’s downward trend to its expense fees, as the company charges $20 for every $1,000 invested, or two percent.

Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at financial services firm TF Global Markets U.K. Ltd., told Bloomberg that "expense ratios are insane for these funds and the current Bitcoin price is creating more problems."

Last month, Chainalysis published a study revealing that BTC investors and speculators held their positions over the summer, while markets seem to have become more stable overall.

The monetary aggregates reportedly were “extremely steady” during the summer, showing that the amount of BTC held for speculation was stable from May to August at around 22 percent of available BTC.
