# Ripple Escrow Reporting: Creative Accounting or Much Ado About Nothing? ...

###### 2019-05-22 11:05

Coin Metrics distilled these findings into three key summary statements:

- “Two quarterly markets reports under-reported the number of XRP released from escrow by a total of 200 million XRP ($84 million at current prices)
- The ‘escrow queue’ is implemented differently than announced, leading to a faster future release of escrowed funds compared to the announced schedule
- Other party/parties, potentially associated with Ripple, have released 55 million XRP from an unknown escrow address not connected to the main Ripple escrow account.”

The third issue raised by Coin Metrics focuses on 200 million XRP not associated with Ripple’s escrow account.

Cointelegraph contacted Ripple for comments regarding the matter but was instead pointed to a Tweet by David Schwartz, the chief technology officer at Ripple:

Regarding the chatter about reporting methodology around XRP escrow in @Ripple's quarterly XRP Markets Reports: this is simply a timeline issue.

Thus, at the time of Ripple publishing its quarterly report, it will be 100 million XRP behind, even though the balance exists on the on-chain Ripple ledger as having already returned to the company’s escrow.

According to Coin Metrics, the total net amount returned to escrow so far as recorded by on-chain data and the various quarterly reports differs by 200 million XRP.

Speaking to Cointelegraph on the alleged discrepancies, Joe DiPasquale, the CEO of cryptocurrency hedge fund BitBull Capital, declared:

“The alleged discrepancies in Ripple's escrow reporting may impact XRP's price negatively unless Ripple publicly explains them in due time.

Ripple’s monthly escrow releases supplement the total XRP market liquidity, which in turn contributes to the token price control mechanism.
