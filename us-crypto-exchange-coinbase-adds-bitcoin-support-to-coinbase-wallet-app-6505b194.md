United States cryptocurrency exchange and wallet Coinbase has added Bitcoin (BTC) to its Coinbase Wallet app, according to an announcement published Tuesday, Feb. 5.

In August 2018, Coinbase had announced that Toshi, the open source decentralized app browser and wallet developed by Coinbase, will rebrand to become Coinbase Wallet.

As explained by the crypto exchange, Coinbase Wallet is slightly different from the main app, Coinbase (or Coinbase.com).

With Coinbase Wallet, users stores their own crypto protected by their unique private keys.

Coinbase also mentioned again that it is considering adding add Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Litecoin (LTC), and other major cryptocurrencies to its Coinbase Wallet.

As Cointelegraph reported earlier this month, cryptocurrency hardware wallet firm Ledger has unveiled its new Bluetooth-based wallet Ledger Nano X that will allow customers to store 100 crypto assets and control them via a mobile device.

Another major crypto wallet, Blockchain.com, has recently added partial support for Bitcoin SV (BSV), noting, however, that it has no plans to offer full functionality for the crypto at present.
