# UK Crypto Regulation Is Changing, Recognition Looming at Long Last ...

###### 2019-08-13 09:08

As industry bodies like CryptoUK as well as other commentators have complained, the lack of regulatory clarity and the presence of suspicion toward cryptocurrency has been holding back the U.K.'s crypto industry.

However, the situation has slowly begun to change in recent months, with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) updating its guidelines on cryptocurrencies, and with a series of consultations on crypto regulation due to begin toward the end of the year.

## Gaps and uncertainties

Still, even though the cryptocurrency industry has been able to gain an initial foothold in the U.K. within the present legislative environment, industry groups and figures believe that specific crypto-focused regulation needs to be introduced, in order to provide greater clarity and support for anyone operating an exchange in the U.K. or holding an initial coin offering (ICO).

Toward the end of July, CryptoUK wrote an open letter to the newly installed Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sajid Javid, in which the trade body's chairman, Iqbal Gandham, cited three reasons why the U.K.'s crypto industry was "falling behind other countries."

And while Gandham reaffirmed that the industry "needs regulatory certainty to reach its full potential in future," he nonetheless told Cointelegraph that several positive developments have occurred in recent months, beginning with the FCA's July guidance on crypto assets.

CEO and founder of the U.K.-based CEX.io exchange, Oleksandr Lutskevych, explained to Cointelegraph that industry players were involved in formulating the FCA's latest advice, saying:

"The current guidance implements the experience and knowledge gathered by crypto businesses from the international market over the last few years and represents the position of the major cryptocurrency businesses in the UK.

Because even with the new guidance, the environment is still confused and complicated for exchanges, platforms and other related businesses, with Lutskevych suggesting that the industry has been neglected in the understandable push to protect consumers:

"To us, 'fair' regulation protects customers and clears obstacles to crypto businesses who proactively cooperate with regulators and obey the rules.
