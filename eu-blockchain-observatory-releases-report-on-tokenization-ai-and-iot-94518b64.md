The European Union Blockchain Observatory and Forum released a report entitled “Tokenization of physical assets and the impact of IoT and AI” on April 10.

The report, authored by Dr. Tim Weingärtner, a professor at Lucerne University of Applied Sciences & Arts – School for Information Technology, features the “digital twin” concept, which refers to a digital replica of the physical world.

This mirror world would be consist of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, big data, tokens representing physical objects, blockchain as a trusted ledger and Artificial Intelligence (AI).

The report notes that blockchain would play a key role in this digital transformation by providing trust and allowing the identification and tokenization of physical objects.

At the same time, the report claims, robots and drones would be “the actuators of the digital world,” since they would allow the intervention of the digital world in the physical world.

The document expects the digital twin concept to become increasingly important:

“Due to the exponential growth, which is described by Moore’s Law and many studies, the physical world will be exceeded by the digital world in the coming years.

In March, a different report released by the same organization made recommendations on how to better develop blockchain technology, including the introduction of interoperability and scalability standards.
