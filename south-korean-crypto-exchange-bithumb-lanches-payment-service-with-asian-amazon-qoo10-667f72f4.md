Through this new partnership, it will become possible to purchase products from Qoo10 and pay for them using the Bithumb Cache.

Bithumb’s press release states:

"The partnership with Qoo10 has made it possible for us to utilize the Bithumb cache beyond our home country and abroad for real life.

According to CoinMarketCap, Bithumb is currently the number 76th crypto exchange, with a total 24 hour trade volume of more than $3,028 billion at press time.
