# Stellar’s Blockchain Briefly Goes Offline, Confirming the Project Lacks Decentralization ...

In other words, instead of using an entire network to validate a transaction like bitcoin does, Stellar relies on the so-called quorum slices — sets of nodes that each validator node chooses to agree with.

The Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) — a nonprofit organization committed to the development and adoption of Stellar — believes that the network collapsed because “new nodes took on too much consensus responsibility too soon.”

Specifically, the researchers stressed that the entire Stellar network rested upon a limited amount of nodes, primarily the ones controlled by SDF itself:

“We show that all of the nodes in Stellar cannot run Stellar consensus protocol if only two nodes fail,” the research claims.

In a post-mortem analysis, SDF explained that the network froze because too many new nodes were being added in a bid to make it more decentralized:

“We’ve seen claims that Stellar is ‘over-centralized’ and that somehow a failure with SDF’s nodes dragged down the whole network.

Specifically, Kim told Cointelegraph that, at the time the paper was submitted, if two out of three SDF validator nodes went offline, the Stellar network would collapse.

To deal with the aftermath of network failure and bring it back online, SDF included all three of its validators into quorum sets, according to Kim, and hence have returned “back to step 1,” in which if two out of three SDF validator nodes go down, the Stellar network will collapse.
