Israeli Bitcoin (BTC) investors are unable to pay their taxes as banks do not accept deposits obtained from cryptocurrencies.

## Israeli banks freeze up the minute they hear “Bitcoin”

Israeli newspaper Haaretz reports on Aug. 6 that local crypto investors are unable to deposit the returns of their Bitcoin investments into bank accounts due to money laundering and terrorist financing concerns.

Those two factors reportedly result in the Israel Tax Authority expecting taxes from Bitcoin investors, who find themselves incapable of paying them since they cannot deposit the earnings resulting from their investments as local fiat currency onto local bank accounts.

## Tax authorities aware of the problem

Since he was unable to pay his dues to the Israeli tax authority, a lien has been put on his bank account, home, and scooters.

Haaretz further writes that the local tax collector is aware of 300 million shekels (over $85.7 million) in unpaid tax due on the earnings from Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, but the figure is probably much higher.

The outlet also cites the case of Roy Arav, another Bitcoin investor who held his profits on a trustee account at Discount bank operated by local cryptocurrency exchange Bit2C.

As Cointelegraph reported at the beginning of June, the Supreme Court of Israel has declared that Leumi Bank cannot block the local cryptocurrency exchange Bits of Gold’s account on the grounds of regulatory concerns.
