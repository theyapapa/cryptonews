A platform that says it offers an intelligent and faster way of trading cryptocurrencies has announced a collaboration with Binance, the largest crypto exchange in the world.

The company claims it is the world’s first crypto platform to offer “Bracket Trading” across global exchanges — a tool that brings together buy price, sell price and stop loss into one place for individual traders.

It is also possible for Koinfox customers to emulate the bracket trades of reputed users, copying their strategies in a live environment, if they so wish.

The mission of Koinfox is to help crypto investors trade profitably by enabling them to execute better decisions using our intelligent trading platform.”

Since then, the platform says it has enjoyed “significant acceptance and adoption by the global crypto trading community,” attracting more than 25,000 users in a matter of weeks since its launch.

## Brackets explained

According to Koinfox, bracket trading gives users “the power of much increased leverage with increased protection” and helps ensure that profitable positions do not transform into losses.

Koinfox, which is headquartered in Australia, says it enables its users to try bracket trading through a simulated platform, where dummy tokens allow new traders to try out their strategies and see how they would have performed in a live environment.
