# Unconfirmed: TRON to Partner with ‘China’s Google,’ Baidu ...

###### 2018-10-13 12:10

The team of cryptocurrency project TRON (TRX) has reportedly partnered with China's largest Internet search provider Baidu.

Crypto market news service Coinness has claimed this in a tweet Thursday, Oct. 11, citing its private correspondence with TRON’s team.

Neither TRON nor Baidu have been able to confirm the partnership to Cointelegraph as of press time.

Without specifying the details of the partnership, Coinness has claimed that the deal between TRON and China’s Internet giant Baidu will be “officially” revealed by the cloud storage service Baidu Cloud “next week.”

While Coinness claims that TRON has exclusively confirmed the partnership in private correspondence with it, the crypto platform itself has not yet officially announced any details of the partnership or even the identity of its new business partner.

TRON’s CEO Justin Sun has recently hinted on Twitter at a secret partnership with an unnamed “industry giant” that is valued at “tens of billions of dollars.”

In late September, TRON released details about its partnership with a popular torrent client BitTorrent, following the earlier acquisition of the company.
