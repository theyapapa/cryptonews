Big four auditing firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) is the top recruiter for blockchain-related jobs on recruitment platform Indeed, search results showed at press time on March 30.

At press time, PwC is responsible for 40 blockchain-related job offers on the platform.

Other big four auditing firms are apparently recruiting professionals in this niche on the platform: more precisely, Ernst & Young posted 17 such announcements, while Deloitte posted 10.

This leaves Klynveld Peat Marwick Goerdeler (KPMG) as the only big four auditing firm not recruiting blockchain professionals on the platform.

Tech giants IBM and Oracle posted ten job offers related to blockchain as well, while global management, consulting and professional services firm Accenture posted 11.

In November last year, Accenture deployed a distributed ledger technology platform created to manage and track software licenses.

In February, news broke that Accenture is working with major global firms including Mastercard to introduce a blockchain-based circular supply chain.
