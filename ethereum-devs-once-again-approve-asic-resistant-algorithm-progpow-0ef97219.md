# Ethereum Devs Once Again Approve ASIC-Resistant Algorithm ProgPoW ...

###### 2019-03-17 15:03

Ethereum (ETH) core devs once again discussed the proposed Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC)-resistant Proof of Work (PoW) algorithm ProgPoW during their weekly meeting on March 15.

This week, the devs again reached an overall consensus that the algorithm should be implemented, while the timeline for its implementation remains unclear.

When discussing the algorithm, the developers argued over how effective ProgPoW will prove to be at diminishing the efficiency advantage of ASICs.

After first reaching a consensus for the implementation of the algorithm in early January, Ethereum developers changed their mind and delayed the decision until the algorithm is audited by a third party in the beginning of February.

As of about a month ago, Ethereum holders nearly unanimously supported the ProgPoW algorithm implementation.

As Cointelegraph reported in January, an Ethereum code contributor had suggested that Ethereum developers “embrace” ASICs in a post on Ethereum developer forum Ethereum Magicians.

As Cointelegraph’s analysis dedicated to the algorithm and the controversies surrounding it notes, the potential implementation ProgPoW has stirred up various theories and rumors in the community.
