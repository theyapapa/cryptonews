Major South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb has reportedly signed a deal with an American fintech firm in an effort to open a securities token exchange in the U.S., South Korean Yonhap News agency reported Nov. 1.

Sources purportedly told Yonhap that SeriesOne will establish the exchange in the U.S. during the first half of 2019, while Bithumb provides investment and the necessary technical support for operating the exchange.

Earlier this month, Bithumb announced that it would launch a global decentralized crypto exchange.

The exchange will be launched in partnership with blockchain firm One Root Network (RNT), which developed an Ethereum-based decentralized token transaction protocol called R1.

Last week, Hong Kong-based crypto exchange Changelly revealed that it had helped Bithumb recover some tokens that were lost during a devastating hack in June.

Changelly stated that it was able to return 1,063,500 Ripple (XRP) tokens to Bithumb, which at the time of the hack were worth about $585,000.

According to CoinMarketCap, Bithumb is currently the number one crypto exchange, with a 24 hour trade volume of $1.7 billion.
