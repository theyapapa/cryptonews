Bitcoin (BTC) is reverting to its historical 90%+ market dominance at altcoins’ expense, one of the industry’s best-known figures has declared.

## Back: Bitcoin will hit 90% dominance again

In a Twitter debate with Primitive Fund co-founder Dovey Wan on Sept. 9, Blockstream CEO Adam Back said altcoins’ previous supremacy was a temporary feature of the cryptocurrency space.

Wan had queried whether Bitcoin would continue making market cap gains, and if these would become a permanent new status quo.

As Cointelegraph reported, Bitcoin’s share of the overall crypto market cap now stands at around 70%, its highest since March 2017.

The scales have shifted in BTC’s favor dramatically this year; at one point in 2018, Bitcoin accounted for less than 40% of the cap.

As such, he said, building on arguments he made in August, Bitcoin should end up back at 90% market cap dominance or even higher, as was the case prior to 2015.

Meanwhile, separate research has already argued Bitcoin’s actual position among cryptocurrencies is already more than 90%.
