The Second United Arab Emirates (UAE) Government Annual Meetings concluded with the introduction of two initiatives pertaining to blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI), the Emirates News Agency reported Nov. 28.

At the meeting hosted by the governmental AI and Blockchain Joint Working Group, participants addressed strategies to attract foreign investment and create necessary technological infrastructure, as well as potential challenges related to blockchain and AI adoption.

The meeting announced the launch of the AI and Blockchain Guide Initiative, which aims to develop a standardized definition of the technologies on the federal level, as well as introduce the concepts of AI and its deployment to relevant entities.

The program will provide university courses and scholarships in AI and blockchain technology under the purview of the Ministry of Education.

Omar bin Sultan Al Olama, Minister of State for Artificial Intelligence, commented on the initiatives:

“The UAE is keen to adopt AI and blockchain technologies in all the economic, health, educational and other vital sectors.

Attendees outlined the importance of keeping pace with technological changes and achieving the UAE’s goal to become a leading country in the adoption of AI by 2031 through the UAE Strategy for Artificial Intelligence.

Earlier this week, Al Hilal Bank, based in Abu Dhabi, announced it completed “the world’s first sukuk transaction” with the use of blockchain technology.
