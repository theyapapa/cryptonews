The decentralized exchange (DEX) developed by major cryptocurrency exchange Binance will block access to users based in 29 countries.

The DEX informs potential users of the restriction via a message that appears when accessing the platform from one of the regions.

The message appearing on the platform states:

“It seems you are accessing www.binance.org from an IP address belonging to one of the following countries:

USA, Albania, Belarus, Bosnia, Burma, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Cote D’Ivoire, the Crimea region of Ukraine, Croatia, Cuba, Herzegovina, Iran, Iraq, Kosovo, Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, Macedonia, Moldova, Serbia, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, Syria, Venezuela, Yemen, or Zimbabwe.”

The pop-up also warns about how trading and accessing the wallet interface through the website will be blocked for users with IP addresses from the aforementioned countries.

A Twitter user well known among crypto enthusiasts, Whale Panda, commented:

“Reminder that it was never a DEX so stop calling it a DEX.

A Steemit post dedicated to the topic links to a list of suggested crypto asset trading platforms that do not require users to go through Know Your Customer procedures.

As Cointelegraph reported at the time, Binance launched its decentralized trading platform earlier than planned, in the second half of April.
