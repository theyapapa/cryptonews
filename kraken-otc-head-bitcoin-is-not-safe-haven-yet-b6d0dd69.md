###### 2019-08-25 10:08

Head of over-the-counter (OTC) sales at cryptocurrency exchange Kraken Nelson Minier compared today’s cryptocurrency trading industry to how Wall Street used to be, adding that it is still too soon to call Bitcoin a safe haven for investors.

## Too early to call Bitcoin a safe haven

The interviewer also touched on the topic of the increasingly popular idea that Bitcoin (BTC) is becoming a safe haven asset due to its lack of exposure to the monetary policy restrictions that fiat currencies are subjected to.

Minier answered that he believes it is too early to call Bitcoin a safe haven asset given its high volatility.

He also admitted:

“So, I’m not so sure that it’s a safe haven asset yet, but I do think that it’s starting to act like one.

And when the market is getting shaky you saw Bitcoin rise, I mean, you wouldn’t see that before, it was trading like a risky asset.”

Lastly, he concluded that despite it's too early to call Bitcoin a safe haven, “we’re heading that way for sure.”

As Cointelegraph recently reported, senior analyst at market strategy and sector research company Fundstrat Global Advisors Tom Lee is confident that Bitcoin already became a genuine safe haven for investors.
