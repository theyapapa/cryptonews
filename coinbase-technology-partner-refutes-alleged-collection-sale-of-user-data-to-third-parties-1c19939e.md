London-based blockchain analytics firm Elliptic — which provides technology to major United States crypto exchange Coinbase — has refuted allegations that it collects and sells clients’ user data to third parties for financial gain.

In an official statement published on March 4, Elliptic’s CEO and co-founder James Smith stated that the firm has never “enabled the violation of individuals’ financial privacy,” and that such accusations represent a fundamental misunderstanding of Elliptic’s industry role.

Elliptic is one of key players in the blockchain intelligence sector, providing analytics tools that allow companies, governments and law enforcement agencies to monitor blockchain transactions and track suspected illicit activities, such as money laundering.

As reported, accusations that such players may be circulating their clients’ user data surfaced when a senior Coinbase executive was prompted to justify the exchange’s now-controversial acquisition of blockchain analytics firm Neutrino.

In his statement, Smith robustly denied these allegations, which did not explicitly isolate Elliptic or any other blockchain intelligence firm by name.

Smith added:

“Our exchange clients, including Coinbase, do not provide us with any personally identifiable information about their users.

In addition to Smith’s statement, Elliptic has published an extensive FAQ in which it outlines the exact mechanisms and nature of the data it uses for transaction screening and the analysis of potentially suspect actors and funds transfers.
