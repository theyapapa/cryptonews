Blockstream Chief Strategy Officer (CSO) Samson Mow says Bitcoin (BTC) is bad for payments but the Lightning Network solves this.

## Lightning changes the whole equation

Mow conceded that he doesn’t yet have an everyday use case for Bitcoin (BTC), quipping that in daily life, he still uses credit cards, not cryptocurrency.

I’ve said this before, and people have twisted around and said I hate Bitcoin, but Bitcoin is bad for payments.”

For payments, Mow said, we have the Lightning network: instantaneous and virtually free — designed exactly with everyday payments in mind.

As a payment system, he recalled, Bitcoin takes ten minutes on average for transactions to be settled — this being an average, it can also take as much as three hours at times.

And while Mow may still be using credit cards, he noted that Lightning — as a virtually zero-fee network — has the potential to change the whole equation once it reaches wide adoption.

They’re all copies of Bitcoin’s concept \[...\] without that kind of virgin birth \[...\] someone is able to assert authority over the network and control the roadmap or have influence over that.”
