# Coinbase-Backed Stablecoin Startup Reserve to Launch ‘Venmo Style App’ in Venezuela ...

Stablecoin project Reserve announced that it will launch a crypto-fiat payments app in Venezuela and Angola in a press release shared with Cointelegraph on May 12.

Per the press release, the project’s stablecoin app — to be launched for Android users via Google Play “in the coming weeks” — will enable people and businesses to switch back and forth from their local fiat currency to the firm’s stablecoin, the Reserve Dollar (RSD).

Nevin Freeman, co-founder and CEO of Reserve, told Cointelegraph that the reason the app is launching in Venezuela in particular is linked to the extreme level of inflation in the country, noting:

“A lot of people, including some of our investors, discouraged us from starting in Venezuela.

\] The hyperinflation there is the exact problem that Reserve is built to fix, and Venezuela is suffering the most inflation of anywhere in the world right now, so we felt that it had to be done.”

The press release claims that there are currently 16 countries with annual inflation greater than 20%, but that the situation in Venezuela is particularly troubling, with the Venezuelan bolivar losing nearly 10% of its value every day.

As Cointelegraph reported in February, the deepening of the country’s currency crisis has seen increased use of bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies in the region.

Reserve also reported that it has landed a partnership in Angola with 7Mobile Africa — reportedly the largest mobile importer in the country — to pre-load the app on all its shipped smartphones.
