###### 2019-03-03 13:03

## BNB/USD

Binance Launchpad platform has concluded a successful sale of the Fetch.AI (FET) token within 22 seconds on Feb. 25.

On the other hand, if the bulls fail to scale and sustain above $12, a few days of consolidation or a minor dip cannot be ruled out.

## LTC/USD

The Litecoin (LTC) Foundation has partnered with premier kickboxing league Glory to make LTC the official cryptocurrency for Glory’s various events and its online merchandise platform.

## XRP/USD

Ripple (XRP) got listed on the Coinbase Pro trading platform on Feb. 25.

On Feb. 28, Coinbase announced support for the digital currency on its retail platform and mobile apps.

Although there was a lot of talk about JPM, the recently announced stablecoin by JPMorgan Chase, a research by Binance has concluded that it will not be a threat to Ripple’s XRP token in the near term.

On the other hand, if the price fails to break out of the resistance of the range, it will consolidate for a few more weeks.
