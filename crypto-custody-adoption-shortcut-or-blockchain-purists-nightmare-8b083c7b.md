# Crypto Custody: Adoption Shortcut or Blockchain Purists’ Nightmare? ...

As crypto assets become a prominent part of the financial ecosystem, with institutional actors leveraging immense volumes of cryptocurrency, the question of how to go about storing and handling digital wealth at scale comes to the fore.

Alex Lam, co-founder and CEO of digital asset services platform RockX, observed to Cointelegraph that custodians in the crypto space do for institutional actors what hot and cold wallets do for retail investors:

“For large financial institutions and corporations who trade on a much larger scale than regular market participants, the security provided by trusted third parties bearing the burden of custodianship will give these legacy organizations the confidence and certainty they have come to expect in more traditional markets.”

Many stakeholders of the digital asset domain expect institutional custody to do the same job in the still-volatile cryptocurrency markets, serving as a legitimizing force for the industry in the eyes of both regulators as well as capital-rich financial firms wary to invest in the space.

Charles Lu, CEO of Findora, a blockchain service for building decentralized financial applications, said in a statement to Cointelegraph that he sees maturing custodial services in the blockchain sector as lowering the barriers for institutional investors to enter the market, which is a welcome development:

“Institutional investors require built-in support for automated compliance, as well as security, privacy and transparency.

Tom Maxon, head of CoolBitX’s operations in the United States, emphasized the role that financial regulators play in shaping the custodians’ business, telling Cointelegraph that:

“Custodians tend to be large and reputable firms that are responsible for holding customers’ assets or securities for safekeeping in order to minimize the risk of their theft or loss.

Maxon added that the role that centralized exchanges currently perform in the crypto space is similar to that of institutional custodians, although such platforms are not particularly well-equipped for this position, saying, “It is widely-known that centralized exchanges are often hacked, making them unreliable and too risky for centralized crypto exchanges to be considered custodians by regulators.”

Some experts who spoke to Cointelegraph on the matter saw the expansion of concentrated custody as a compromise between the crypto movement’s foundational ideas and the need to funnel institutional money into the space for the sake of mainstream adoption.
