# Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Stellar, EOS, Litecoin, Bitcoin SV, TRON, Cardano: Price Analysis, Dec. 24 ...

###### 2018-12-24 15:12

The next move down will find strong support at the 20-day EMA and below it at $3,787.33.

If the price stays above the 20-day EMA for the next 2â€“3 days, we anticipate another attempt to break out of the 50-day SMA.

On the other hand, if the BCH/USD pair turns down from the 50-day SMA, it might find support at the 20-day EMA.

On the other hand, if the bears defend $123.98 on a closing (UTC time frame) basis, the BSV/USD pair might remain range bound for the next few days.

We might propose long positions if the next dip holds above $0.0183 or the 20-day EMA.

## ADA/USD

Cardano is attempting to break out of the 50-day SMA and rise to the next overhead resistance at $0.060105.

Traders who have about 50 percent of their positions left can either book the rest of the profits at this level or trail the stops very closely.
