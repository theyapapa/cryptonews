Chinese authorities arrested fifteen men suspected of corrupting an internet café administrator to mine cryptocurrency.

Local crypto industry news outlet 8BTC reported on Sept. 3 that police in Henyang, a city in south central China’s Hunan province, arrested the man for cryptojacking.

Local police received a report suggesting that many local Internet cafes were running cryptojacking malware.

The findings of the preliminary investigation suggest that the malware has been developed by a network technology company in Zhengzhou, and the company’s head is surnamed Zhang.

Zhang is suspected of personally bribing the internet cafe administrators to let him install the malware on their computers.

All of the 15 men allegedly involved are now under arrest and the investigation is still ongoing.

## Not the first mining-related arrest

In July, police in China also arrested 22 suspects allegedly involved in illegal crypto mining activity that stole electricity worth about $3 million.
