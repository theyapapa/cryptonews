French police have shut down a massive botnet that has been used for Monero (XMR) cryptojacking.

According to the police, the botnet was distributed by sending virus-laden emails with offers for erotic pictures or fast cash, and further propogated through infected USB drives.

The virus, called Retadup, ultimately infected 850,000 computers in over 100 countries — thus creating a massive botnet.

The chief of C3N — the French police’s cybercrime unit — Jean-Dominique Nollet spoke on France Inter radio about the power of a botnet this size, saying:

"People may not realise it but 850,000 infected computers means massive firepower, enough to bring down all the (civilian) websites on the planet.”

## Additional details and aftermath

The French police were able to find the botnet’s server, which was located in Paris, and disinfect the hundreds of thousands of affected computers by redirecting the virus to a harmless destination on the internet with the help of the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation or FBI.

## More XMR cryptojacking from France?

The researchers believe that this XMR miner also originates from France, or a French-speaking country.
