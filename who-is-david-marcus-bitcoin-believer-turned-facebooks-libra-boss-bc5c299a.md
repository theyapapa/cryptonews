Marcus led Messenger for four years before the entirely new chapter of his career opened with Facebook’s announcement of him taking charge of the newly established exploratory blockchain task force — the initiative now known as Libra.

David Marcus is believed to be among the first in the world of big tech to start experimenting with cryptocurrencies, as Asaf Fybish, co-founder of blockchain marketing firm GuerrillaBuzz, told Cointelegraph:

“David Marcus is actually considered as one of the first top Silicon Valley executives to adopt and support bitcoin.

Later the same year, speaking at the aforementioned LeWeb conference, Marcus opined that cryptocurrencies had a greater chance of revolutionizing the payments industry within the next 10 years than, say, NFC tap-to-pay technology.

Although it initially might have seemed that the move to Facebook had lured Marcus much farther away from his cryptocurrency aspirations than he was at PayPal, destiny took him full circle to end up at the helm of the social platform’s blockchain project just a few years later.

While at PayPal, Marcus remained in a wait-and-see mode, saying in a 2014 interview that it was critical for a payments company present in more than 90 countries to understand the regulatory implications of starting to accept cryptocurrency across all its jurisdictions.

Prior to unveiling Libra, Marcus projected Facebook’s cautious stance on cryptocurrency — for example, citing the functional hurdles in the way of blockchain-enabled payments — saying:

“Payments using crypto right now is just very expensive, super slow, so the various communities running the different blockchains and the different assets need to fix all the issues, and then when we get there someday, maybe we’ll do something.”

Stephanie So, co-founder and chief development officer of blockchain security startup Geeq, observed to Cointelegraph that Marcus is well qualified for his job, but that this should not eliminate concerns over Libra’s governance model:

“I would say that David Marcus clearly has spent his career running and understanding the payments industry.
