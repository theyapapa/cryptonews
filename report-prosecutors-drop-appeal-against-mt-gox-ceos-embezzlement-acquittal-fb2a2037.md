Japanese prosecutors have reportedly dropped their appeal to the acquittal of former Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles, The Mainichi reports on March 29.

On March 15, the CEO of the now defunct Mt. Gox cryptocurrency exchange was acquitted of charges of embezzlement, but was found guilty of tampering with financial records.

Karpeles was reportedly accused of taking 341 million yen ($3 million) of customers’ money in Mt. Gox accounts and spending it on a software developer and personal extravagances such as a canopy bed.

While being acquitted of the aforementioned alleged embezzlement, the Tokyo District Court found Karpeles guilty of mixing his personal finances with those of the exchange in order to conceal the platform’s losses to hackers.

Citing sources familiar with the matter, The Mainichi reports that Karpeles’ lawyers, in their turn, are contemplating whether to appeal the charges of tampering with financial records.

Mt. Gox was based in Tokyo and had been providing about 70 percent of Bitcoin (BTC) transactions worldwide before suffering a major cyber attack, which led to its bankruptcy.

In 2011, the price of Bitcoin on the Mt. Gox exchange dropped to a record low of one cent due to a security breach.
