Former head of institutional platform group at Coinbase crypto exchange Adam White is reportedly joining Intercontinental Exchange’s (ICE) platform Bakkt.

White left Coinbase in early October, declining to comment on his decision.

As per The Block’s source, Bakkt has now hired White as its Chief Operating Officer.

As Cointelegraph previously reported, White has been working for Coinbase for almost five years and was its fifth-ever employee, joining the team at the time it gathered in a one-bedroom apartment and Bitcoin (BTC) was trading at around $200.

While White was working for Coinbase, the company deployed a series of services targeted at big institutional clients, such as custodian services and an index fund.

For instance, this October Coinbase welcomed a board member of the Charles Schwab bank Chris Dodds, and in September it hired Fannie Mae’s former General Counsel Brian Brooks as its new Chief Legal Officer.

Moreover, this summer a former Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft employee Tim Wagner joined Coinbase as vice president (VP) of engineering.
