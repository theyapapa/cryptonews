Major United States stock exchange Nasdaq has unveiled a blockchain decentralized finance (DeFi) index Defix (DEFX).

According to a Defix press release published on Sept. 9, brokerage firm Exante streamlined the launch of the Defix index.

## A disparate group of crypto assets

The index includes crypto assets of projects such as the one of Proof-of-Work blockchain Amoveo (VEO), decentralized exchange protocol 0x (ZRX), prediction market Augur (REP).

Amoveo main developer Zack Hess commented on the development:

“\[I am\] glad to see increased awareness being brought to decentralized finance projects.”

## A broker specialized in crypto funds

Exante launched its Bitcoin (BTC) fund in 2012.

Furthermore, the firm also released the XAI fund, composed of six major altcoins Ether (ETH), Ethereum Classic (ETC), Monero (XMR), XRP and Zcash (ZEC).

As Cointelegraph reported at the end of August, Elwood Asset Management — owned by British billionaire and Brevan Howard founder Alan Howard — is planning a $1 billion venture into the crypto hedge fund space.
