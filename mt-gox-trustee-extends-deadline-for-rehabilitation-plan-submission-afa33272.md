The trustee of now-defunct Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox has extended the deadline for submission of rehabilitation plans, according to an official announcement published on the company’s website on April 25.

Per the announcement, the exchange’s Rehabilitation Trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi filed a motion in a bid to extend the submission deadline of a rehabilitation plan at the Tokyo District Court.

Accordingly, it is not possible at this moment to make appropriate provisions in a rehabilitation plan on modifications of the rights of the rehabilitation claims, repayment methods, and appropriate measures for the undetermined rehabilitation claims and therefore to submit a rehabilitation plan by April 26, 2019.”

In June 2018, Japanese court approved a petition for the exchange to begin civil rehabilitation, which had the knock-on effect of repaying creditors in BTC and ending the bitcoin sell-offs.

On March 19, Kobayashi announced that he had concluded processing creditors’ rehabilitation claims and that they will be notified of the results within days.

Later in April, the trustee said that all creditors who filed rehabilitation claims had received a decision, but warned the timing and method of repayment had not been determined.

In early April, Andy Pag, the founder and coordinator of Mt. Gox Legal (MGL) — the largest group of creditors of Mt. Gox — quit his post and decided to sell his claim.
