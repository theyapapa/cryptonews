Fortress Investment Group is buying bitcoin (BTC) claims from Mt. Gox creditors, according to a report by CoinDesk on July 8.

The Japan-based cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in 2014 after losing $473 million worth of bitcoin at the time due to an apparent hack.

According an apparent copy of such a letter, Fortress has offered to buy the bitcoin claims back at approximately double the bankruptcy value.

The value of the claims at the time Mt. Gox was declared insolvent was reportedly $451, while Hourigan says Fortress can offer $900 per coin.

As Cointelegraph reported in April, Mt. Gox creditors may have claims for their lost bitcoins being automatically filed on their behalf.

A Reddit user named DerEwige circulated an unverified screenshot of an email, which says:

â€œThe creditors who objected to your self-approved rehabilitation claim withdrew their objections.

DerEwige interpreted this to mean that Mt. Gox users that did not file a rehabilitation claim after losing their crypto have had a claim automatically filed on their behalf, which has now been approved.
