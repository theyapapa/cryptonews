Brendan Eich, the CEO of decentralized browser Brave, has urged members of the U.S. senate to consider the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as a regulatory model, according to a statement published Oct. 2.

In an open letter dated Sept. 29, Eich called on members of the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, to look to the GDPR as a model for American data privacy regulations.

First proposed by the European Commission in 2012, the GDPR legal framework for personal data protection became effective in the European Union (E.U.) on May 25.

He states that the primary principles of the GDPR are based on those which the U.S. endorsed in the OECD Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data in 1980.

He further explains:

“As regulators broaden their enforcement of the new rules in Europe, the GDPR’s principle of ‘purpose limitation’ will begin to prevent dominant platforms from using data that they have collected for one purpose \[...\] to the benefit of other parts of their business in a way that currently disadvantages new entrants.

In September, Brave browser filed privacy complaints in Ireland and Britain against Google, stating that Google and the advertising technology industry practice “wide-scale and systematic breaches of the data protection regime” in the way they publish personalized online ads.

Brave is reportedly trying to trigger provisions in the GDPR, which would require a E.U. investigation into Google’s data collection practices.
