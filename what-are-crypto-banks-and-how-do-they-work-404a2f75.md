# What Are Crypto Banks and How Do They Work? ...

More than a decade later, the grandfather cryptocurrency is still on the peripheries of traditional finance, yet the decentralized industry that it has spawned can indeed replicate many financial services on the blockchain, all of which were formerly exclusively in the realm of banks.

By allowing people to connect to new decentralized lending, exchange, savings and other DeFi platforms, blockchain can provide a cryptocurrency alternative to traditional banking services, and those who are comfortable operating in this ecosystem are therefore able to wield their assets with greater fungibility.

In places with progressive policymakers such as Germany, businesses and institutions holding fiat money and fiat-money-based assets can easily participate in the decentralized economy through a crypto bank.

Its partnership with European Union-regulated SolarisBank ensures that account holders are able to do with Bitwala the same as what they’d do with their regular bank account — i.e., get paid, pay rent and bills, exchange currencies, send interbank payments, and store money in both fiat and cryptocurrencies seamlessly.

## A convincing yet futile facsimile

Due to the unique capabilities of blockchain finance, many of the largest centralized crypto firms are able to offer bank-like services for other enterprise-level businesses, even where regulations haven’t taken shape.

This is because, without regulatory approval, fiat can be turned into crypto (and vice versa), but fiat and crypto do not belong to the same definition of money as it pertains to banks.

According to the report, “If counterparties were to exchange cryptocurrency assets (digital currencies that do not need a central regulating body) rather than fiat currencies, for example, payments could be made and settled in minutes via blockchain, rather than in days as with current systems.”
