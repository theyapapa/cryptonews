# Proof of Keys Event Aims to Challenge Perceived Centralization of Cryptocurrencies ...

The “Proof of Keys” event aimed against centralized exchanges is happening today, Jan. 3, spearheaded by Bitcoin (BTC) investor Trace Mayer.

The Proof of Keys event is essentially a bank run on centralized exchanges, wherein activists are called to withdraw all their cryptocurrency funds from centralized trading platforms and store them in their own wallets.

The idea behind this is to reassert holder control over their crypto assets and to make sure that exchanges are actually in possession of as much funds as they claim.

In a YouTube video giving insight into the Proof of Keys event, Mayer states that cryptocurrency holders should decide whether to reclaim their “monetary sovereignty” or continue waiting “14 days to get \[their\] coins.”

Mayer further says:

“What if some of these exchanges have been dipping into customer assets because \[it is easier\] to make payroll \[...\] than it is to fire people?”

On Jan. 1, Mayer accused cryptocurrency exchange HitBTC in freezing account withdrawals on the threshold of the Proof of Keys event.

Roubini said that crypto decentralization is a “myth,” adding:

“...miners are centralized, exchanges are centralized, developers are centralized dictators (Buterin is "dictator for life" ) & the Gini inequality coefficient of Bitcoin is worse than North Korea."
