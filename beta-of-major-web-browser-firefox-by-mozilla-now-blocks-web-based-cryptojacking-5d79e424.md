###### 2019-04-09 13:04

Major open-source browser Mozilla Firefox has launched new protections against crypto mining malware in its new browser versions, according to a blog post published on April 9.

In its latest Firefox Nightly 68 and Beta 67 versions, Mozilla has enabled a new level of protection against crypto mining and fingerprinting hack attacks in a part of the browser’s Content Blocking suite of protections.

The new browsing feature has been developed in collaboration with privacy and security software firm Disconnect, and represents a collection of blacklists of malware domains associated with fingerprinting and crypto mining scripts.

The new Firefox protection is currently not enabled by default, but can be enabled in the Privacy and Security settings’ section, the blog post notes, adding that the protections will be turned on by default in Nightly in the coming weeks.

As Cointelegraph reported at the end of August last year, Mozilla has already announced that it will block cryptojacking malware in future versions of Firefox.

Recently, a Japanese court acquitted a man who was accused of the illicit mining of crypto by using online crypto miner Coinhive.

Previously, a Ukrainian man faced up to six years in prison for alleged placing crypto mining malware scripts on his own websites.
