American software corporation Microsoft has released a serverless blockchain-powered Azure development kit, according to an announcement published Nov. 15.

The new product dubbed the “Azure Blockchain Development Kit” purportedly improves the capabilities of Microsoft’s Azure Blockchain Workbench.

Per the blog post, the initial release will focus on three core objectives, such as “connecting interfaces, integrating data and systems, and deploying smart contracts and blockchain networks.”

Microsoft says that the development kit includes SMS and voice interfaces, Internet of Things (IoT) device integration, support for mobile clients, bots, virtual assistants, and other related solutions.

In terms of smart contract interaction, Microsoft included Workbench integration scenarios into the development kit in such areas as the legacy apps and protocols, data, Software as a Service (SaaS), and registries, that generate a custom registry and registry item smart contracts.

Microsoft has also introduced a whitepaper dubbed “DevOps for Blockchain Smart Contracts,” explaining how to use the development kit for blockchain-based apps in certain business environments.

In August, Azure introduced a proof-of-authority (PoA) algorithm on its Ethereum (ETH) blockchain product, that purportedly allows a “more efficient” way of building decentralized applications (DApps) for private or consortium networks, where “all consensus participants are known and reputable.”
