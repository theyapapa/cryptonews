The United States Chamber of Digital Commerce has taken aboard cryptocurrency exchange ErisX.

Per a press release shared with Cointelegraph on July 18, ErisX has become a member of the Chamber of Digital Commerce, an advocacy group that promotes the digital asset and blockchain industry.

ErisX thus joined other heavyweights of the industry such as Fidelity Investments, Overstock.com’s Medici Ventures, enterprise blockchain software firm R3, stablecoin platform TrustToken and professional services company Accenture, among many others.

ErisX CEO Thomas Chippas stated:

“The Chamber of Digital Commerce and its member initiatives are very much aligned with our objective to improve the digital asset trading and investing landscape.

Perianne Boring, founder and president of the Chamber of Digital Commerce, said that “we look forward to bringing ErisX’s experience as a regulated market to the Chamber and to their participation in our efforts to educate policymakers as well as advocate for digital assets and blockchain technology.”

ErisX is ostensibly planning to make digital asset futures contracts available for trade on its regulated derivatives market later this year via its new DCO.

Earlier this year, the Chamber urged the U.S. government to implement a national action plan on blockchain technology.
