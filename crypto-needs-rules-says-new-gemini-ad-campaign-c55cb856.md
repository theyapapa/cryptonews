# ‘Crypto Needs Rules’ Says New Gemini Ad Campaign ...

###### 2019-01-04 21:01

The Gemini cryptocurrency exchange founded by the Winklevoss twins in 2014 is calling for better regulation of the crypto space in a new ad campaign, the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reports on Jan. 4.

Placards on taxis and in the New York City subway contain slogans like “crypto needs rules” while simultaneously suggesting that Gemini already provides a regulatory compliant exchange for investors.

Chris Roan, head of marketing at Gemini, told the WSJ:

“We believe that investors coming into cryptocurrency deserve the exact same protections as investors in more traditional markets, adhering to the same standards, practices, regulations and compliance protocols.”

Some in the crypto space have criticized the ads, saying that the introduction of anti-money laundering (AML), Know Your Customer (KYC) and other security measures is antithetical to the founding principles of cryptocurrencies.

Neha Narula, director of the Digital Currency Initiative at the MIT Media Lab, told the WSJ that regulations are not consistently applied throughout the crypto space.

In an effort to ensure that the crypto space does not suffer from an overly-strict legal framework, American legislators have introduced a bill in the the House of Representatives dubbed the Token Taxonomy Act.

The act would exclude tokens from being considered securities, and provide a new definition for crypto assets.
