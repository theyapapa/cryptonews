# Australia’s Central Bank: Cryptos Will Not Receive Wide Acceptance in the Near Future ...

Cryptocurrencies will not receive wide use in Australia as long as the local financial system is efficiently working, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) stated in an official document issued on June 20.

According to the notice authored by analysts from RBA’s payments policy department, there is "little likelihood of a material take-up of cryptocurrencies for retail payments in Australia in the foreseeable future" due to a number of reasons.

In the document, authors outlined the so-called "scalability trilemma,” which means that crypto can at best solve only two out of the three basic features such as decentralization, scalability, and security.

Another obstacle to the wide acceptance of crypto assets is increased volatility, the RBA said in the document.

In the document, the RBA cited particular cases of attempted stablecoin launches in Australia, claiming that stablecoins’ use for payments “has been very limited” as “has the supply of Australian dollar-linked stablecoins.”

The RBA authors conclude that cryptocurrencies have not developed enough to represent a “compelling proposition that would lead to their widespread use in Australia” as long as the Australian dollar provides a “reliable, low-inflation store of value.”

Recently, Australia’s securities regulator released new initial coin offering and cryptocurrency guidelines, considering cryptocurrency to be a financial product, which requires involved parties to get an Australian financial services license.
