# ‘Godfather of ETFs’ Says Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds Will be Approved ‘No Time Soon’ ...

Reggie Browne, the so-called “godfather of ETFs,” said that Bitcoin (BTC) Exchange-Traded Funds (ETF) will be certified “no time soon,” Business Insider reported Nov. 1.

Browne is a senior managing director and head of ETF trading at financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald.

Speaking at Georgetown University's Financial Markets Quality Conference in Washington D.C., Browne reportedly said that BTC ETFs will be approved only after the development of a strong regulatory framework in the industry.

Addressing the current state of BTC ETFs, Browne stated:

"It's very difficult for the \[Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)\] to wrap their heads around a positive approval because there's no data yet ... the markets just aren't here."

Following some widely publicized rejections of BTC ETF applications by the U.S. SEC, the CEO of crypto payment startup Abra Bill Barhydt suggested that the reason the SEC has insofar denied crypto ETFs is because the crypto industry does not fit the applicant archetype.

In particular, the SEC has rejected crypto ETF applications because “people who are doing the applications don't fit mold of who the SEC is used to approving."

In August, the SEC temporarily rejected nine applications to list and trade various BTC ETFs from three companies, including ProShares, Direxion, and GraniteShares.
