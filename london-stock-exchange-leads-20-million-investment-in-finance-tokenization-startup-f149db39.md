# London Stock Exchange Leads $20 Million Investment in Finance Tokenization Startup ...

The London Stock Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) has led a $20 million investment round in fintech startup Nivaura, Reuters reported on Feb. 27.

The startup provides blockchain solutions that automate the issuance, clearing and settlement of financial instruments, including bond issuance and tokenized securities.

LSEG’s head of international development, Nikhil Rathi, told Reuters that the Nivaura investment aligns with the exchange operator’s aim to harness new technology that can diversify products, provide efficiency gains and boost growth.

Tokenizing debt and equity, Nivaura contends, can cut processing time for financial instruments by up to 80 percent, and dramatically reduce the costs of raising capital.

The platform also allows issuers to “easily access the financial markets and can connect into existing technology platforms such as the clearing systems or into blockchain infrastructures.”

For its issuance of an Ethereum (ETH)-denominated, blockchain-settled bond in late 2017, Nivaura operated under the aegis of the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority’s regulatory sandbox — thus tackling the full gamut and complexity of the legal and regulatory issues involved in tokenizing capital markets.

As reported, LSEG’s technology solutions provider, LSEG Technology, has recently announced that its low latency, scalable matching engine — in use at traditional exchanges such as LSE, Borsa Italiana, the Oslo Stock Exchange and others — will be used to power a forthcoming Hong Kong-based digital assets exchange.
