JPMorgan’s Global Market Strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou says that Bitcoin (BTC) could make a resurgence on Wall Street, according to an article published by CNBC on Feb 6.

“The stability that we are seeing right now in the cryptocurrency market is setting the stage for more participation by institutional investors in the future,” said Panigirtzoglou, “The cryptocurrency market was a new market.

Panigirtzoglou predicts that firms will show a renewed interest in cryptocurrencies as stability in the market grows and as Bitcoin’s underlying blockchain technology grows more important.

He added that a Bitcoin’s resurgence could be years away, as regulators are a “bit slow to realize” the potential of the cryptocurrency.

Many have predicted that increased involvement from institutional investors on Wall Street would inject much-needed capital into the cryptocurrency space, particularly after markets suffered a bear year in 2018.

However, some reports from late last year suggest that Wall Street has postponed its crypto plans, as the bear market continued to sink lower.

Twitter’s CEO Jack Dorsey remains optimistic about the future of Bitcoin as it is purportedly the only cryptocurrency that he owns.
