Citigroup and Nasdaq are among a group of firms investing $20 million dollars in Symbiont.io Inc, Bloomberg reports on Jan. 23.

Symbiont’s blockchain and smart contract platform, Assembly, will be applied in capital markets.

According to Bloomberg, Symbiont will use the funds to work on private equity, mortgages, data management, and syndicated loans.

Symbiont CEO Mark Smith told Bloomberg in an interview that the blockchain and crypto space is maturing:

“We are entering a much more realistic phase where people look at this technology and think seriously about where it makes sense to apply it and where it doesn’t.

Together with several large corporations’ plans to launch major blockchain-based projects this year, 2019 is thus reportedly set to be “the year that blockchain technology finally becomes normal.”

While investment from Nasdaq and Citigroup shows that some major institutional players are still interested in the blockchain space, another recent report from Bloomberg claims that Wall Street has postponed its crypto plans.

Major firms are reportedly scrapping plans to enter the crypto space as prices continue to waver.
