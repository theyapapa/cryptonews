XRP is seeing negligible price change on the day, while its 7-day and 1-month charts are indicating losses of over 3% and 27% respectively.

Among the remaining top ten coins, the picture is checkered, with all percentage changes on the day capped within a 2% change both red and green.

EOS, Bitcoin SV (BSV), Stellar (XLM) and Binance Coin (BNB) are all in the red — with BSV reporting the largest loss, of just 1.7%.

Widening out to the top twenty, the charts remain a mixed bag, with only slight fluctuations again capped below 2% either way.
