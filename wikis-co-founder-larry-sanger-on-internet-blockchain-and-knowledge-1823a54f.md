The project was ultimately unsuccessful, but Sanger kept developing educational projects as well as a crowd-sourced news portal before becoming the chief information officer of Everipedia in 2017 — an encyclopedia of unrestricted topics, based on blockchain technology.

Sanger spoke about Everipedia, saying:

“I think it's going to take several years before there are mature decentralized apps that a lot of people are able to use.

## Complementing the internet with blockchain

According to Sanger, the internet of today could not have been created by any modern executive in Silicon Valley — and no, Mark Zuckerberg is not an exception.

As Sanger said, Blockchain technology is adding “transparency, accountability and, of course, the incentives that are provided by tokenization,” but “there is nothing magical about a blockchain technology that makes it the only way to decentralize online activity.”

However, the qualities of blockchain consist for Sanger of “being a way of giving financial incentives to open-source developers.”

## Blockchain in 10 years

To Sanger, the blockchain industry needs to pay a lot more attention to user experience.

Sanger explained:

“Most people just don't care about blockchain at this point.
