###### 2019-02-20 07:02

United States-based cryptocurrency exchange and wallet service provider Coinbase has added support for Bitcoin Cash (BCH) to its Coinbase Wallet, according to an announcement published on Feb. 19.

The update states that users can now store Bitcoin Cash on Coinbase Wallet, adding:

“The new Wallet update with Bitcoin Cash support will roll out to all users on iOS and Android over the next few weeks.”

As Cointelegraph wrote in August 2018, Coinbase Wallet was introduced as a rebranding of the firm’s open source decentralized app (DApp) browser and wallet, formerly called Toshi.

The rebranded wallet has several different features from the main app, Coinbase (or Coinbase.com), reportedly aimed at providing more transparency and security.

Coinbase Wallet allows users to store their own private keys on their devices, buy and store crypto-collectibles, use third-party DApps and receive airdrops and tokens from initial coin offerings.

Earlier this month, Coinbase added support for Bitcoin (BTC) to its Wallet app.

Last week, the firm announced that Coinbase Wallet users can now back up their private keys on cloud storage, namely on Google Drive and iCloud, leading to mixed reactions from the crypto community.
