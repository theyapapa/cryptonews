The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) has introduced new regulations for blockchain firms that are operating in the country.

The document describes the firms that are subject to regulations as websites or mobile apps that provide information and technical support to the public using blockchain technologies.

The guidelines require blockchain startups to allow authorities access to stored data, and to introduce registry procedures that would require ID card or mobile numbers from its users.

China first released draft guidelines in October for blockchain companies, which also contained recommendations that sought to eliminate anonymity in blockchain.

At the time, Asian newspaper The South China Morning Post wrote about an anonymous open letter that alleged sexual harassment at a top Chinese university that was published on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain in April.

The media outlet believes the publication of the letter could be a motivation behind the new regulations.

China is currently mainly piloting blockchain legislation in three regions â€” Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.
