Portland State University (PSU) researchers have made a blockchain protocol to prevent counterfeit pharmaceuticals from filling the market, according to a press release published on April 15.

PSU researcher and professor of computer science at the Maseeh College of Engineering and Computer Science, Nirupama Bulusu, in collaboration with PSU computer science doctoral student Naif Alzahrani published a work dubbed "A new product anti-counterfeiting blockchain using a truly decentralized dynamic consensus protocol."

Bulusu reportedly stated that the decision to create the protocol was due to the fact that the counterfeit pharmaceutical crisis harms the most vulnerable international populations.

Recently, IBM and data storage firm Seagate announced a joint initiative to fight counterfeit hard drives using blockchain technology.

The project will reportedly use IBMâ€™s Blockchain Platform to help manufacturers, integrators, and business partners better authenticate the provenance of hard disk drives.

VinX plans to develop a token-based digital wine futures platform based on the Bordeaux futures model, that will enable the trade of wine futures on a blockchain platform.

The initiative purports this will create a secure supply chain that assures product provenance and thus reduces fraud in the wine industry.
