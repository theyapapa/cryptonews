Security and “systemic risk” will form the focus of the third Stanford Blockchain Conference at Stanford University on Jan. 30 - Feb. 1, organizers have revealed.

Continuing the institution’s ever increasing interest in blockchain technology, the three-day event will see presentations and discussions on a variety of technical issues.

Chaired by Stanford professors, among others, the event will see contributions from multiple cryptocurrency businesses, with input from names such as Blockstream, ConsenSys and Polychain Capital.

Talks will come from representatives of industry businesses including Stellar-focused startup Interstellar and smart contracts platform Chainspace.

The conference, which first ran in 2017, “will explore the use of formal methods, empirical analysis, and risk modeling to better understand security and systemic risk in blockchain protocols.”

Organizers wrote as part of the introduction to this year’s event that “multidisciplinary collaboration” is a main theme:

“We aim to foster multidisciplinary collaboration among practitioners and researchers in blockchain protocols, distributed systems, cryptography, computer security, and risk management.”

Stanford has sought to offer students more direct study of blockchain in recent times, in June this year opening a dedicated blockchain research center.
