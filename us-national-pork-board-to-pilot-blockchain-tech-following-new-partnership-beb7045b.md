The United States National Pork Board has partnered with blockchain startup ripe.io to test out a blockchain platform for pork supply chains, according to a press release published on March 18.

Raja Ramachandran, co-founder of ripe.io, revealed that "through blockchain, customers like the National Pork Board can enable its organization and members to create shared, immutable trusted records that address critical food issues such as sustainability, quality, traceability, waste and fraud."

Waste from large-scale pig farming has become an issue of concern for residents of states like Iowa and North Carolina, where the industry has a significant presence.

Blockchain technology has been deployed by many companies around the world in order to enable greater supply chain efficiency.

Recently, North Americaâ€™s largest branded shelf-stable seafood firm Bumble Bee Foods launched a blockchain platform for seafood traceability in partnership with German tech company SAP.

The new platform can purportedly monitor the supply chain of yellowfin tuna from Indonesia to end customers.

CQL is touted to guarantee consumers complete product traceability across the entire supply chain.
