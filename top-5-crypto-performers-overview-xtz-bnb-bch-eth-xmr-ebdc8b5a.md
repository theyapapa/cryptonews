Though cryptocurrency trading is banned in China, the ruling party sees the renminbi as a cryptocurrency in about 20 years, according to Donald Tapscott, executive chairman of the Blockchain Research Institute.

We believe the resurgence is being led by binance coin (BNB), which is the best performer among major cryptocurrencies and might become the first to scale the highs made during the bull run in January of last year.

Crypto exchange Binance earned $78 million in profits in Q1 2019, a growth of 66% over the comparable quarter of the previous year.

## BCH/USD

Bitcoin cash (BCH) was the main beneficiary of bitcoin SVâ€™s delisting by major crypto exchanges this week.

The ETH/USD pair is facing a stiff tussle between the bears and the bulls at the critical $167.32 level.

The next couple of weeks are critical for the cryptocurrency, as it will determine the next directional move.

The XMR/USD pair has been sustaining above the breakout level of $60.147 and the 20-week EMA for the past two weeks.
