# Bitcoin Trailblazer Jeff Garzik Says Bitcoin ‘Unquestionably a Success’ as Store of Value ...

Bitcoin (BTC) pioneer Jeff Garzik has said that while the leading cryptocurrency may not have evolved into a means of payment as he first envisaged, it is still “unquestionably a success” as a store of value, in an interview with Bloomberg Nov. 9.

Speaking soon after Bitcoin’s 10th anniversary, Garzik – reportedly the “third-biggest contributor” to Bitcoin’s code and one of Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto's key collaborators – told the publication:

“It hasn’t evolved in the direction of high-volume payments, which is something we thought about in the very early days: getting merchants to accept Bitcoins.

As Bloomberg outlines, Garzik began writing software code for Bitcoin as early as July 2010, after reading a blog post about the as yet incipient project.

According to Bloomberg Garzik has over the course of his activities given away Bitcoin valued at over $100 million (15,678 BTC) at today’s market prices.

Garzik continued coding for the Bitcoin project until 2016, and now sits on the boards of crypto payments processor Bitpay, mining tech firm Bitfury, and the Linux Foundation.

As an advocate of the contentious Bitcoin hard fork SegWit2x back in 2017, Garzik is no stranger to controversies in the crypto development community.

Community divisions have reignited this summer – this time over a forthcoming Bitcoin Cash hard fork – between the warring factions of leading BCH client Bitcoin ABC, and nChain, the blockchain development firm of Craig Wright – who has previously referred to himself as the true Satoshi.
