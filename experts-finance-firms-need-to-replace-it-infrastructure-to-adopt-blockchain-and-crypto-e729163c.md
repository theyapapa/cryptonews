Industry experts say that financial institutions will have to replace their existing internal IT infrastructure for greater adoption of blockchain and digital currencies, Scotland’s national news outlet the Scotsman reported Nov. 9.

Delivering a speech at the ScotChain18 conference in Edinburgh devoted to blockchain technology impact on commerce, Jeremy Drain of cryptocurrency-focused software company Libra reportedly stated that “there’s an assumption by some companies that their current infrastructure will accept crypto and blockchain.”

Drain further explained that those firms’ data is too different, so their systems are unable to work with blockchain and crypto.

CEO of recruitment firm MBN Solutions, Michael Young said that since “many” companies investigate blockchain and its adaptation to their business strategies, it will have an impact on the ability of traditional IT infrastructures to support the “new order.”

Young concluded:

“Without exception, the success stories seem to have one characteristic in common: they needed the right infrastructure in place to ensure the rapid, seamless, and secure transmission and processing of data on the blockchain.

Whilst this is not an issue for many startup ventures in the blockchain space, this may mean a complete rethink for large corporates looking to keep pace with this foundational technology.”

The project aims to “confirm the viability of blockchain technology” and will use an unnamed “digital currency” to make settlements.
