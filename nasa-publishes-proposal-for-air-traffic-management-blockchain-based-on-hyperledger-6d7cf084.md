The proposed system would employ an open-source permissioned blockchain to enable secure, private and anonymous communication with air traffic services.

The document notes:

“This framework features certificate authority, smart contract support, and higher-bandwidth communication channels for private information that may be used for secure communication between any specific aircraft and any particular authorized member.”

The engineering prototype of the system reportedly employed the Hyperledger Fabric and demonstrated that such infrastructure could be rapidly deployed and economically maintained.

In December of last year, Hyperledger — an open source project created by the Linux Foundation and created to support the development of blockchain-based distributed ledgers — onboarded 12 new members, including such major firms as Alibaba Cloud, Citi and Deutsche Telekom.

According to the proposal, enterprise blockchain solutions could be a practical PKI for aircraft applications.

As Cointelegraph reported in August 2018 in an analysis dedicated to blockchain in space NASA had awarded a $330,000 grant in 2017 that supported the development of an autonomous, blockchain-based spacecraft system, making its first move toward blockchain adoption.

Also, in December of last year, news broke that blockchain development firm Blockstream has expanded its satellite service with the fifth satellite and is now broadcasting the Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain to all of Earth’s major land masses.
