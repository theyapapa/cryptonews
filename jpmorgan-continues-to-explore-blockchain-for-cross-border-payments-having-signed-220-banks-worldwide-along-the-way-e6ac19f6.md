# JPMorgan Continues to Explore Blockchain for Cross-Border Payments, Having Signed 220 Banks Worldwide Along the Way ...

On April 21, it was revealed that JPMorgan Chase (JPM), the United States’ largest bank with over $2.62 trillion in assets, is planning to widen the use of its blockchain system.

Specifically, JPM is adding new features to its Interbank Information Network (IIN), which is now used by more than 220 banks across the globe.

Attempts to construct some new way of transacting on blockchain look to us like a solution in search of a problem,”

Sungmahn Seo, head of Europe, Middle East and Africa payments and foeign exchange at JPMorgan Chase, told Euromoney in October 2018, outlining the INN’s primary goal:

“However, when a cross-border payment does get stuck for whatever reason, that can get quite painful.

Thus, instead of handling cross-border payments like Ripple-created XRP and other SWIFT-killers that aim to overtake the conventional money transferring structure and put it on blockchain rails, the IIN is merely an encrypted distributed ledger network that allows participants to identify themselves and share information necessary for sending money — and not necessarily large amounts — to each other.

As John Hunter, JPM’s head of global clearing, told the Financial Times, the IIN members will be able to instantly verify whether a payment is heading to a valid bank account — as per the new update, scheduled to go live by the third quarter of 2019.

Eyal Shani believes that the use of smart contracts and blockchain will indeed allow the IIN to minimize the number of such errors:

“By tokenizing the system and enabling the use of modern smart contract and flexible coding, the IIN could solve better and faster compliance problems and other payment errors.

Thus, although the banking giant’s other recent crypto project, JPM Coin, was received quite poorly by the community, part of which deemed that JPM Coin is not a cryptocurrency at all, JPMorgan continues to explore the field of blockchain — and given the large amount of bank who have co-signed its project, the U.S. financial titan might be headed in the right direction.
