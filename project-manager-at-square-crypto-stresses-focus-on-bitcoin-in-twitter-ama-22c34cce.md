Steve Lee, a project manager at Square Crypto — the crypto arm of the payments company Square — made a number of recent remarks that solidify the company’s emphasis on Bitcoin (BTC).

Early on in the AMA, Lee described Square Crypto as “an open-source initiative designed to strengthen the bitcoin ecosystem.”

## Square Crypto or Square Bitcoin?

Over the course of the AMA, one user even asked Lee why the group called themselves “Square Crypto” instead of “Square Bitcoin.”

## Square stock up with Bitcoin rally

Square stock is also on a roll this year as crypto markets recovered from last year’s “crypto winter.”

As Cointelegraph reported last week, Square stock is up over 50% in 2019, while Bitcoin’s price has soared over 150% since Jan. 1.

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Square unveiled Bitcoin deposits for its Cash App at the end of June.
