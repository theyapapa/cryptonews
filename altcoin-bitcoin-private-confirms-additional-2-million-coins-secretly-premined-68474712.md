The development team behind altcoin Bitcoin Private (BTCP) has confirmed the creation of 2.04 million units of BTCP “that were never intended to exist on the blockchain,” according to an official statement published Dec. 24.

On Dec. 23, digital assets analytics website Coin Metrics published a report revealing that during the import of Bitcoin (BTC) chain data, an additional 2.04 million units of altcoin BTCP — about $3.9 million at press time — were secretly minted.

The BTCP core team says in today’s statement that upon receiving the reports, they “immediately launched an investigation to ascertain whether or not the alleged findings of an additional amount of BTCP coins were true.”

The BTCP team further discovered that one line missing in the code “allow\[ed\] the fork mine to be exploited due to the nodes not properly verifying the falsified fork blocks.”

The BTCP team further notes it is not clear whether those coins were transferred to an exchange or used or stored elsewhere.

The BTCP team also stated in the announcement that they had “no prior knowledge” of the incident before Coin Metrics’ report was released to the public.

At the end of the statement, the BTCP team writes that they have contacted major crypto exchange HitBTC about the situation.
