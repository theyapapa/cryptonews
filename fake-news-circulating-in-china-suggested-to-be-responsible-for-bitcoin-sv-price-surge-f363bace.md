Co-founder of cryptocurrency investment holding firm Primitive Ventures Dovey Wan suggested that fake news circulating in China may be responsible for yesterday’s bitcoin sv (BSV) price surge.

According to Wan, a screenshot circulating on Chinese social media showed a fake article about self-proclaimed bitcoin creator Craig Wright having transferred 50,000 bitcoin (BTC) from the biggest bitcoin wallet in existence to cryptocurrency exchange Binance.

According to the report, the transfer would be proof that Wright is Satoshi Nakamoto and created bitcoin.

The fake report posted by Wan also claims that Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao reacted to the development by promising to re-list BSV and publicly apologize.

Wan commented stating that, while she does not know how much the alleged fake reports contributed to the price surge, “this fake news snapshot went viral in many Chinese retail groups around the same time.”

She also claimed that people who believed the news “got super excited,” and added:

“CHINESE RETAIL IS THE BEST HERD EVER”

Another Twitter user contradicted this last idea, stating that many retail investors know that some news — even when fake — can lead to a price surge and see it as a trading opportunity.

As Cointelegraph recently reported, Craig Wright has filed United States copyright registrations for the bitcoin white paper authored by Satoshi Nakamoto.
