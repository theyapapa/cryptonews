The National Electronics and Computer Technology Center (NECTEC) of Thailand has developed blockchain technology for e-voting, the Bangkok Post reports on Jan. 2.

NECTEC is a statutory government organization that operates under the purview of the National Science and Technology Development Agency and the Ministry of Science and Technology.

Chalee Vorakulpipat, the head of the cybersecurity laboratory at NECTEC told the Bangkok Post:

"Nectec developed blockchain technology for e-voting that can be applied to national, provincial or community elections, as well as business votes such as the the board of directors.

While widespread blockchain-based e-voting has the potential to make elections faster, cheaper and more secure, it will take time to ensure that each voter has access to a mobile internet connection and identity verification.

Other countries have also been considering using blockchain technology to secure and conduct election processes.

Following the 2018 federal mid-term elections in the United States, the Secretary of State of West Virginia reported a successful trial of mobile blockchain voting for West Virginians in the armed services stationed overseas.

Both the Swiss city of Zug and the Japanese city of Tsukuba have conducted trials of blockchain voting in municipal elections.
