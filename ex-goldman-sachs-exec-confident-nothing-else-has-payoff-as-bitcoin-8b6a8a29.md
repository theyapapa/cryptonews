# Ex-Goldman Sachs Exec Confident ‘Nothing Else Has Payoff’ as Bitcoin ...

###### 2019-08-01 08:08

Raoul Pal, a former head of equities and equities derivatives at Goldman Sachs UK office and the founder of Global Macro Investors and Real Vision Group, believes that Bitcoin (BTC) is worth betting on in the long term — even if it’s just a 1% chance.

## Potential rewards outweigh the risks

According to Pal, the potential reward of buying Bitcoin far outweighs all the accompanying risks.

He also referenced crypto analyst PlanB’s tweets containing a couple of different stock to flow models based around the tapering off in supply due to scheduled halvings of BTC block reward.

## Bitcoin is predicted to increase to $1 million in coming years

Notably, the most recent PlanB’s chart suggests the Bitcoin price will increase to $100,000 after next year’s halving.

## Early $200 bet on Bitcoin turned out to be prophetic

Ex-Goldman Sachs exec also mentioned that he has a long history with Bitcoin and was “probably the first person to put together a valuation using the above-ground supply and below-ground supply of gold, and imputing that into Bitcoin, which was basically the Stock-Flow model at a very simplistic level.”

On July 30, former Bitcoin bear Joe Kernen also predicted that BTC could hit $55,000 by May 2020, the date of next halving.

At press time, Bitcoin is trading at around $10,000 — up 2.12% on the day, according to Cointelegraph’s Bitcoin Price Index.
