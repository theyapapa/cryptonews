Germany plans to introduce draft regulations allowing blockchain bonds as soon as this summer, local daily business news outlet Handelsblatt reported May 9.

Citing Thomas Heilmann, the ruling coalition government’s dedicated blockchain correspondent, the publication revealed the new legislation has already gained mainstream momentum, with a summary paper already in existence.

According to Heilmann, it is both necessary and advantageous for Germany to embrace blockchain with supportive regulation.

“We consider it to be of paramount importance that we bring blockchain technology forward for Germany, specifically in 2019,” Handelsblatt quoted him as saying.

Germany has traditionally taken a conservative stance on both blockchain and cryptocurrency, with the country showing itself to be wary of bitcoin (BTC) and other tokens in particular.

“The national government has finally woken up,” Frank Schaeffler, the blockchain expert for Germany’s Free Democratic Party, continued.

And this week, the country passed new regulation concerning tokenization and blockchain regulation.
