# Top-5 Crypto Performers: EOS, LEO, ETC, ADA, XMR ...

###### 2019-07-28 11:07

Though Bitcoin prices have also corrected in the past few days, the leading digital currency has managed to hold market dominance above 64%.

## ETC/USD

Though Ethereum Classic (ETC) has declined over 4% in the past seven days, it has turned out to be the third-best performer among major cryptocurrencies.

The price turned down from the overhead resistance of $10 after bulls failed to scale it for five weeks (enclosed in an ellipse on the chart).

This shows that the price is likely to remain inside the range for the next few weeks.

During the week, it rallied to become the tenth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.

However, bulls have not been able to push the price higher in the past seven days.

## XMR/USD

Monero (XMR) is attempting to make a place in the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.
