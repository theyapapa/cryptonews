# Overstock’s tZERO Security Token Platform Begins Live Trading ...

###### 2019-01-24 20:01

E-commerce giant Overstock.com’s cryptocurrency subsidiary tZERO announced that secondary trading of tZERO tokens is now live, according to a press release published Jan. 24.

Per the release, accredited investors can trade the security tokens through a digital securities brokerage account at Dinosaur Financial Group, which will act as a broker-dealer.

Dinosaur partnered with tZERO subsidiary PRO Securities, which provides an alternative trading system for secondary trading of tZERO security tokens.

CEO of tZERO Saum Noursalehi said:

“The world of security tokens has lacked a regulated venue for secondary trading.

The trading of our own security tokens is the crossing of the Rubicon for the new world of digital assets.

Earlier this month, tZERO filed a patent for a “crypto integration platform” for trading digital assets.

Such items include securities, tokens, digital shares, cash equivalents and digital assets.
