Stellar-focused (XLM) crypto development company Interstellar appointed the founder of digital payments network Zelle Mike Kennedy as its new CEO.

## Stellar as an international payments system

Kennedy’s network Zelle is the payment system used by JPMorgan Chase, Citi, Bank of America and many other financial institutions, according to its website.

Now, Interstellar expects Kennedy and his team to build new services for Stellar.

The Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) has developed what I believe is the best blockchain based payments network, enabling fast and inexpensive international payments.”

We will solve the remaining problems, turbocharging adoption and growth — making international payments better for millions and millions of companies and end users.”

## Not the only announcement

Alongside Kennedy’s appointment, Interstellar also announced that it is “spinning-out a new app-focused company” called Pogo, which has been in stealth development for some time.

The company in question reportedly aims to achieve wallet interoperability and the post explains that the app takes advantage of Stellar’s distinguishing features:

“As you’ll see when the service goes live, Pogo is the kind of application that Stellar is uniquely positioned to enable, thanks to the network’s ability to create low-friction, high-liquidity, real-time corridors for FX settlement between financial entities.”
