# Google Cloud Integrates Chainlink Oracles in Analytics Data Warehouse With ETH DApp Support ...

The Google Cloud team has integrated Chainlink’s oracle middleware with its BigQuery enterprise cloud data warehouse, allowing for an on-chain and cloud-based interaction with Ethereum decentralized applications and smart contracts.

As previously reported, a blockchain oracle is a system that provides the necessary external data — i.e. the variables to be evaluated — to trigger the execution of a smart contract when the original terms of the contract are met.

The development post writes that Google has made public blockchain data for eight different cryptocurrencies freely and publicly available in BigQuery through its Google Cloud Public Datasets Program.

Google’s way to solve this task is to enable the Ethereum smart contract platform to interact with its BigQuery enterprise cloud data warehouse automatically and on-chain by using Chainlink’s oracle middleware.

This allows for a smart contract to be triggered using data that is retrieved from an on-chain query to the internet-hosted data warehouse.

Google notes that the system can be generalized to develop hybrid cloud-blockchain applications, in which smart contracts efficiently delegate complex operations to cloud resources.

This May, blockchain platform Qtum — which like the Ethereum platform focuses on smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps) — revealed its collaboration with Google Cloud as a software partner to increase the ease of launching native products for users.
