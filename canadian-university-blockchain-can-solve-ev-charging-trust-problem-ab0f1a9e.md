# Canadian University: Blockchain Can Solve EV Charging Trust Problem ...

Researchers at the University of Waterloo in Canada have used blockchain technology to improve trust in electric vehicle (EV) charging systems, reported academic publication portal EurekAlert on Aug. 14.

## New ventures have no established trust relationships

In general, an EV charging service provider will look for property owners to partner with and install charging points.

Owners of electric vehicles can then use these for a fee, which is shared between the equipment supplier and the property owner.

## The added benefit of blockchain

The researchers established three steps to incorporating blockchain into the system to reduce the reliance on trust.

First is to identify the involved parties and what (if any) trust issues there may be.

Second is to design a minimal blockchain solution to mitigate these trust issues.

Researcher and PhD student, Christian Gorenflo, said:

“Mitigating trust issues in EV charging could result in people who have charging stations and even those who just have an outdoor outlet being much more willing to team up with an EV charging service provider resulting in much better coverage of charging stations.”
