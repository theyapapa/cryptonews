# Japan to Check Money Laundering Policies of Crypto Exchanges Ahead of FATF Inspection ...

Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) is reportedly cracking down on crypto exchanges that offer anonymous transactions or have weak identity verification practices in preparation for inspection by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) this fall.

The FATF will reportedly send its investigatory arm to review the strength of the Japanese FSA’s anti-money laundering (AML) policies, which includes policy for crypto exchanges and other financial services.

Japan reportedly was given the worst possible score for identity verification in financial institutions in a 2008 report by the FATF.

According to the report, Japan was the first country to implement a registration system for cryptocurrency exchanges.

In October, the FATF amended its rules to include crypto exchanges in its AML regulatory framework, and implored G-7 member countries to start implementing strategies for registration, licensing, and monitoring crypto exchanges.

Japan is hosting the Summit on Financial Markets and the World Economy (G20 2019) in Osaka this June, and will be expected to talk address the forum on international crypto regulations and initial coin offerings (ICOs).

As previously reported on Cointelegraph, Japanese FSA revealed in January that there are currently seven pending applications for crypto exchange licenses in the country.
