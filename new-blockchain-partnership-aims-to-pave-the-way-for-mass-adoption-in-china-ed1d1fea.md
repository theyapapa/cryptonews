A blockchain platform and a mobile gaming company have unveiled a partnership designed to benefit hundreds of millions of users.

High Performance Blockchain (HPB) has announced it is the first public chain to team up with gaming company Shanghai Youwan — paving the way for widespread adoption by the customers of some of China’s biggest brands.

Through the partnership, Shanghai Youwan’s mobile games will be connected with the HPB wallet, expanding the ecosystems of both parties.

As a result, a broader number of apps and companies will be able to use HPB coins and benefit from what the scalable blockchain has to offer.

The company says that “an immense portion of the public” are going to be exposed to the company’s blockchain as a result of the partnership — and in time, both businesses hope to work together more closely in other sectors, such as health care, food, housing and transportation.

“The scope of this partnership, and initiatives at hand is another signal that is showing the world that blockchain adoption is happening, and the potential it has to be integrated into our daily lives,” the companies said.

HPB believes its solutions are going to provide an additional layer of security in Shanghai Youwan’s data, and help the company cater to user demand and consumption preferences far more effectively than it did before.
