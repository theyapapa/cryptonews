Two businesses in the United States state of Ohio have paid taxes with cryptocurrencies, state Treasurer Robert Sprague said in a forum on Feb. 19.

Ohio became the first state to allow businesses to pay taxes with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) in November 2018.

During a forum covering policy issues facing the state, Sprague said that the treasury has only collected two receipts for tax payments using cryptocurrencies.

With that, Sprague emphasized that the Ohio state treasury does not manage cryptocurrency themselves, clarifying that they do not accept any other currency than the U.S. dollar.

The treasurer elaborated that crypto tax payments are conducted through a cryptocurrency platform which simply facilitates the exchange from crypto to fiat:

“We will never accept won or renminbi or francs or cryptocurrency, or any other currency.

Ohio has been actively trying to attract blockchain- and cryptocurrency-related businesses to the state.

When the state passed the law allowing business to pay taxes in crypto, then state Treasurer Josh Mandel said that the legislation “plants a flag” in Ohio in terms of national cryptocurrency adoption.
