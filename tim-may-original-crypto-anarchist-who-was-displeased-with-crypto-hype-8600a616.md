Timothy C. May, co-founder of the cypherpunk activist movement and author of “The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto” has passed away at the age of 67.

May is known as the author of “The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto” — published in 1988 — in which he predicted some elements of currently existing decentralized cryptocurrencies.

## “The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto” and the rise of the Cypherpunks movement

In September 1988, May wrote “The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto” essay, which was loosely based on Karl Marx’s “The Communist Manifesto.”

However, May also noticed in the Manifesto that “many of these concerns will be valid,” since “crypto anarchy will allow national secrets to be trade freely and will allow illicit and stolen materials to be traded.”

## May and the contemporary crypto industry: “Satoshi would barf”

May’s ideas were remembered in 2008, when Satoshi Nakamoto began making waves on the internet with Bitcoin’s original white paper.

Moreover, May mentioned that many blockchain use cases and distributed ledgers “are not even new inventions, just variants of databases with backups”, while also arguing that “the idea that corporations want public visibility into contracts, materials purchases, shipping dates \[...\] is naive”.

Finally, May criticized the industry for having “a sheer number” of conferences and crypto exchanges “that have draconian rules about KYC \[Know Your Customer\], AML \[Anti-Money Laundering\], passports, freezes on accounts and laws about reporting 'suspicious activity' to the local secret police."
