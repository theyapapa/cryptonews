Software development behemoth Oracle is suing blockchain startup CryptoOracle, alleging trademark infringement and cybersquatting.

## Cybersquatting and trademark infringement

Technology market news outlet Computer Reseller News (CRN) reported on Aug. 15 that Oracle sued CryptoOracle alleging trademark infringement and cybersquatting in the Northern District of California.

The complaint filed by the tech giant reportedly claims that the startup’s name has been chosen “to trade on Oracle's reputation as an innovator and leader within the technology industry, and to evoke among consumers the goodwill that Oracle has built in its own famous brand."

Oracle, on the other hand, is the software development giant behind Java that also happens to provide blockchain services.

Oracle reportedly first sent a cease and desist letter CryptoOracle filed for trademark rights to its name.

Now, Oracle is asking a federal judge to order the startup to withdraw that trademark application, stop using its name and remove the branding from all web domains that reference it.

Lastly, Oracle’s attorney also reportedly claims that the firm has the right to recover the startup's profits.
