Canadian police have frozen assets of the founders of blockchain consulting firm Vanbex, which raised $22 million in an alleged fraudulent initial coin offering (ICO).

According to the document, Vanbex founders Kevin Hobbs and Lisa Cheng claimed to the public that they operated a Vancouver-based cryptocurrency firm, starting from 2017.

The firm, which was interchangeably called Vanbex and Etherparty, is actually a shell company that developed no useable products, the court document argues.

The police have now frozen two accounts of Vanbex co-founder Hobbs and seized the foundersâ€™ two new Land Rovers, as well as ordered the founders not to sell, borrow or damage their Vancouver condominium for at least 30 days or until a further order from the court.

In a FUEL pre-sale, Hobbs and Cheng reportedly raised more than 30 million Canadian dollars ($22 million), which was allegedly accompanied by a sudden acquisition of substantial wealth by both founders, the document notes.

Following the allegedly fraudulent ICO scheme, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) launched a fraud investigation into Etherparty and Vanbex, as well as Hobbs and Cheng, in May 2018.

The RCMP determined that from May 2017 through July 2018, Hobbs and Cheng were defrauding investors by falsely offering corporate investment in FUEL tokens while not intending to use the invested funds to develop products, but rather with intention to use them for their personal benefit.
