Intel has launched a commercial blockchain package based on the Hyperledger ecosystem, according to marketing materials published on Feb. 12.

Intel, which is a member of the Hyperledger collaboration — hosted by the Linux Foundation along with IBM and other major financial institutions — has announced that its new product is designed for businesses that want to launch their own blockchain fast and effectively.

The ecosystem will be based on the Hyperledger Fabric — a foundation for developing applications or solutions with a modular architecture.

The system has the base configuration that contains the necessary minimum to launch a Hyperledger-driven blockchain.

As Cointelegraph reported earlier this week, other tech giant IBM has also launched its own Hyperledger-based blockchain platform in its data center located in Melbourne, Australia.

Furthermore, IBM announced a project this month using blockchain and the Internet of Things to manage the use of groundwater and thus combat drought in the United States state of California.

The kit is a serverless solution dubbed Azure, which contains features like off-chain identity and data, as well as monitoring and messaging application programming interfaces (API) in a format that can be used to develop blockchain-based apps.
