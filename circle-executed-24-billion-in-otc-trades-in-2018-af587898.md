The over-the-counter (OTC) trading desk at cryptocurrency finance firm Circle had a notional volume of $24 billion in 2018, according to an official Medium blog post on Jan. 3.

According to Circle, the firm now partners with over 1,000 institutional clients such as exchanges, token projects, OTC desks, asset managers, and other global endowments.

OTC trading allows investors to carry out trades directly with one another without relying on the services of an intermediary such as a cryptocurrency exchange.

OTC trading services in digital assets are a particular draw for institutional investors, who are increasingly using the OTC desks of firms like Circle and Coinbase.

As Cointelegraph reported in December 2017, institutional investors as a whole have shifted to higher liquidity OTC Bitcoin (BTC) markets.

Investment is growing in OTC funds like that offered by Coinbase, which launched OTC trading for institutional customers in November 2018.

Coinbase outperformed Grayscaleâ€™s Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) on OTC markets in terms of BTC trade volume.
