EOS developer Block.one is attempting a 10% buyback of its stock, offering backers a share repurchase price that will return as much as 6,567% on their initial investments.

According to Bloomberg, the buyback values the company at around $2.3 billion, up from about a $40 million valuation in the 2017 seed round.

As Bloomberg notes, investors who ostensibly stand to benefit from this return include PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, Jihan Wu of crypto mining hardware giant Bitmain and hedge fund managers Alan Howard and Louis Bacon — all of whom bought into EOS back in July 2018.

As reported today, Michael Novogratz’s crypto merchant bank Galaxy Digital accepted the buyback offer and sold its shares in Block.one for $71.2 million — realizing a 123% return on its initial investment.

In an interview with Bloomberg, Nic Carter — a partner who focuses on blockchain at Boston-based investment firm Castle Island Ventures — remarked that:

“A private buyback of this sort signals to me that the company believes that there are few growth opportunities in sight, or badly wants to consolidate ownership and avoid outside scrutiny.”

As Bloomberg notes, Block.One made a previous stock repurchase offer in which it sought to acquire 15% of its outstanding shares, priced at $1,200 each.

Bloomberg cites a March 2019 email to shareholders that reportedly indicated that EOS’ total assets, including cash and investments, amounted to $3 billion at the end of February.
