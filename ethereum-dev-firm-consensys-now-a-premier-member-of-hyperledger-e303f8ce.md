Ethereum-focused development firm ConsenSys becomes a premier member of blockchain development project Hyperledger, according to a press release shared with Cointelegraph.

## Software already submitted

Per the release, ConsenSys also submitted its Pantheon Java-based Ethereum client to Hyperledger as the project ​Hyperledger Besu.

Besu, which is reportedly the first public chain compatible blockchain submission to Hyperledger, is the fifteenth Hyperledger project.

Hyperledger executive director Brian Behlendorf commented on the submission, saying:

“By submitting the code for Hyperledger Besu right out of the gate, ConsenSys is showing its support for our mission to build a broad coalition for advancing enterprise blockchain.”

## Favoring open and interoperable blockchains

As a Hyperledger member, ConsenSys plans to explore interoperability across blockchains and help drive standards to support enterprise-grade blockchain environments.

He explained:

“As a new premier member, ConsenSys is now an active part of the Hyperledger community and the open-source, open governance approach to blockchain.

As Cointelegraph reported in July, technology behemoth and semiconductors manufacturer Intel has co-sponsored a new blockchain programming project by major blockchain tech firm Hyperledger.
