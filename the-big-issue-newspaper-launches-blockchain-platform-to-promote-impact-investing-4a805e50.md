The Big Issue, a street newspaper sold by the homeless in the U.K. and other countries, is launching a blockchain-driven platform to promote impact investing, The Financial Times reports Monday, Nov. 18.

Three investment companies — UK Standard Life Aberdeen, U.S. Columbia Threadneedle, and AllianceBernstein — will join The Big Issue as founders of the platform dubbed The Big Exchange.

According to the FT, it will offer 30 to 40 social and environmental impact funds, and is set to start working within six months.

The potential investors will be charged a minor fee to use The Big Exchange.

The minimum investment is expected to be $640, but Nigel Kershaw, chairman of The Big Exchange, is planning to reduce it down to £2.50 ($3.20) — the same price as The Big Issue.

As per the FT, the platform has already raised about $1.3 million from three of its founders and London-based fintech company FNZ.

In the following five years, The Big Exchange expects to attract as much as $3.8 million.
