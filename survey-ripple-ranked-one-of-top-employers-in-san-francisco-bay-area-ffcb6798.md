Payment startup Ripple (XRP) has been ranked as one of the best employers in the technology industry in the San Francisco Bay Area, according to a recent survey by research firm Good Place to Work (GPTW).

On the list of the best small to medium companies to work in the Bay Area prepared by GPTW, Ripple was ranked as the 17th top employer.

Out of 35 companies on the GPTWâ€™s list, Ripple seems to be the only blockchain and digital currency-related firm.

Tech news publication TechCrunch noted that companies have to pay for GPTW services like certification and ranking.

In order to be eligible for the list, companies reportedly must allow GPTW researchers to observe the workplaces.

Among the large companies list, GPTW ranked Big Four firms KPMG LLP and Deloitte as the 10th and 14th top employers, respectively, tech conglomerate Cisco as the 11th, software company Adobe as the 12th, and NVIDIA as the 17th.

To prepare the 2019 Best Workplaces in the Bay Area, GPTW reportedly conducted an anonymous survey of over 30,000 Bay Area employees, who responded to more than 60 questions.
