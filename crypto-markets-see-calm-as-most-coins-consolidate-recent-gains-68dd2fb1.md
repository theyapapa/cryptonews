Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $6,580 at press time, down close to 1 percent on the day, according to CoinMarketCap.

During a short-lived spike yesterday, which correlated with Tether’s price drop, Bitcoin traded as high as $6,673, but has since corrected to the price range it saw at the beginning of its weekly chart, despite several days of heavy losses on the crypto markets mid-week.

Today investor and crypto bull Mike Novogratz tweaked his price forecast for Bitcoin, predicting the top crypto would in fact not break $10,000 in 2018.

As reported yesterday, the now second largest crypto exchange by market cap OKEx announced it would be listing four stablecoins at once – PAX, TrueUSD (TUSD), USD Coin (USDC), and Gemini Dollar (GUSD) – the same day as U.S.-based crypto payment processor BitPay announced it had started to accept two stablecoins for merchant settlement, GUSD and USDC.
