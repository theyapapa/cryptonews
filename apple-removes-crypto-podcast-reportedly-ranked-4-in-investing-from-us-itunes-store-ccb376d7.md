###### 2018-11-06 10:11

The podcast hosted by Morgan Creek Digital partner and crypto analyst Anthony "Pomp" Pompliano, “Off the Chain,” has apparently been removed from the U.S. iTunes store Nov. 5.

The podcast reportedly soared to 4th place for podcasts in the “investing” category in the U.S iTunes store, before it was “mysteriously” taken down, according to a tweet from Pompliano Nov. 5.

The podcast description for the episode that allegedly caused the podcast to rise in popularity last week – before being taken down by Apple – details that Pompliano interviewed Murad Mahmudov – described as one of the “highest conviction Bitcoin Maximalists in the world.”

As of press time, searches for “Off the Chain” in the U.S. iTunes podcast store prompt an alert from Apple that the podcast is “not currently available.”

In private correspondence with Cointelegraph, Pompliano provided a screenshot with what appears to be corroborating evidence of his claims that the podcast had sealed the 4th ranking for the investing category.
