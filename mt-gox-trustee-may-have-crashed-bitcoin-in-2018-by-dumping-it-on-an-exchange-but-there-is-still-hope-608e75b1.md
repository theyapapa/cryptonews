# Mt. Gox Trustee May Have Crashed Bitcoin in 2018 by Dumping It on an Exchange, but There is Still Hope ...

###### 2019-02-12 13:02

The now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox reportedly liquidated around $312 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC) throughout February and June of 2018 through a Japanese exchange called BitPoint.

GoxDox, an organization that was established to assist Mt. Gox creditors, released a photograph of a bank account statement on February 5 showing the alleged transactions sent from BitPoint to the Mt. Gox trustee led by Nobuaki Kobayashi.

According to GoxDox, the Mt. Gox trustee began to sell the exchange’s Bitcoin holdings starting in early 2018, possibly even before February.

In February 2018, when the trustee started to sell BTC on a cryptocurrency exchange, Kraken CEO Jesse Powell reaffirmed that the company, which was hired to track the lost coins of the exchange, advised the trustee not to dump millions of dollars worth of BTC in the market.

Instead, Brock Pierce, who claims to acquire Mt. Gox for 2 BTC from Mark Karpeles and Jed McCaleb in 2014, decided to try to reopen the exchange and pay the creditors using the equity of the company.

As a first step, Pierce condemned the work of the Mt. Gox trustee and prevented the trustee from liquidating the company’s holdings with his authority over the company, according to the official statement of GoxRising, a British Virgin Islands-based company established to oversee Mt. Gox:

“Acknowledging that the Mt. Gox trustee had done a laudable job of managing an unwieldy estate, the group suggested that the inherent limitations on the trustee's discretionary powers as a fiduciary, prevented him from maximizing creditor returns going forward.”

## One hurdle worth $16 billion

Mt. Gox could distribute its $1.2 billion Bitcoin holdings in the next two months and rush the process of obtaining a license from Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) to begin operating as a regulated cryptocurrency exchange.
