# Nouriel “Dr. Doom” Roubini: “99 Percent of Cryptocurrencies are Worth Zero” ...

I can see a bubble when there is one — and to me, this entire space has been the mother and the father of all financial bubbles and now it’s \[going to\] burst

Last year, almost everybody I knew was asking me every other day, “Should I buy Bitcoin?”

To watch the interview go here:



## On future price movement and Ethereum being a “scam”

“An academic study suggests that 81 percent of all ICOs were a scam to begin with; 11 percent of them have failed or have died; and of the remaining eight percent that is traded on exchanges, the top 10 have lost on average, in the last year, 95 percent of their value — more than Bitcoin.

And, you know, a typical other program has less than one percent of bugs in its code, and a typical smart contract has 10 percent of its code is buggy \[sic\].

\[At the same time\] there are many problems with the traditional financial systems.

Take, for example, payment systems: There \[are\] already plenty of digital payment systems — that do billions of transactions a day, and are used by billions of people around the world — that are not based on blockchain.

They are digital payment systems based on \[the\] traditional financial institution and fintech.

NR: Of course, it completely failed: After 10 years, there is no killer app; the crypto assets are going bust; they’ve lost 99 percent of their value; all these experiments have led not a single corporation or single financial institution using this technology; and there is no reason why they want to use this technology.
