Crypto exchange giant Binance has made its first strategic Chinese investment after leaving China amid the local crypto trading ban back in 2017.

Founded in China in 2017, Binance has participated in a $200 million funding round of Beijing-based Mars Finance, a local crypto and blockchain publication, Bloomberg reported on Sept. 17.

According to the report, investors also included Singapore-based Matrixport, recently founded by former CEO of Bitmain, and Beijing-based venture capital (VC) firm Ceyuan Ventures.

Mars Finance was established by local entrepreneur Wang Feng in February 2018.

According to Bloomberg, the firm previously completed two funding rounds with investors including leading crypto exchanges OKCoin and Huobi, and major American VC firm IDG Capital.

At press time, the Chinese version of Mars Finance, with the domain huoxing24.com, has around 124,000 monthly visits, with a 70,947 rank in China, according to website traffic tool SimilarWeb.

On Sept. 9, Circle CEO said that no one in the world is closer to launching CBDCs than China.
