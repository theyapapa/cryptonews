Programmer and crypto enthusiast John McAfee revealed his intention to use his 2020 bid for U.S. presidency as a platform to promote permissionless cryptocurrencies in an interview with Cointelegraph Nov. 1.

Speaking with Cointelegraph at the Malta Blockchain Summit today, the founder of McAfee Antivirus Software said he plans to run “around a libertarian platform,” and use his access to the national stage solely to discuss cryptocurrencies, while expressing сonfidence that “no one will elect \[him\] as president.”

McAfee commented that his pro-crypto stance is mainly based on the concept of “personal freedom,” stating that in his coming bid for presidency he wants “to talk about personal freedom and how cryptocurrency can help us achieve that.”

McAfee elaborated that his intention to run to presidency was not to win, but rather to gain a large public platform for promoting decentralized cryptocurrencies, stating:

“That’s \[crypto\] all I’m going to talk about.

McAfee first announced his intention to run for U.S. president in 2020 in order to support the crypto community and promote crypto in early June, 2018.

In the interview today, McAfee also reiterated his prediction from last-year that top cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) will hit $1 million by the year of the U.S. president elections.

However, McAfee clarified that that amount of U.S. dollars will not be the same $1 million that we have today, since fiat currencies will logically flee to crypto markets, adding confidently:

“In five years time fiat will be on its last legs.”
