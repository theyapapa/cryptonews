American cryptocurrency exchange and wallet provider Coinbase has announced the rollout of full trading of the Basic Attention Token (BAT) at Coinbase.com and in the Coinbase Android and iOS apps, per a blog post published Nov. 8.

According to the announcement, Coinbase’s customers can now buy, sell, send, receive, or store BAT along with other digital currencies supported on the platform.

The exchange also notes that BAT will be available for customers in most jurisdictions, except initially for residents of the state of New York.

Coinbase announced that it started accepting inbound transfers of BAT to Coinbase Pro last week, indicating that BAT trading would only start once the coin established sufficient liquidity.

The exchange stipulated that the token would undergo four listing stages, including “transfer-only,” where users will be able to transfer BAT into Coinbase Pro accounts; “post-only,” which would enable customers to post limit orders; “limit-only,” where limit orders start matching; and the final stage “full trading,” which gives full access to trading services, including limit, market, and stop orders.

After the previous announcement, the BAT price spiked, surging by over 20 percent on the day.

In October, Coinbase added support for 0x (ZRX), making it the first ERC-20 token available for trade on the platform.
