India’s Institute for Development and Research in Banking Technology (IDRBT) has published a blueprint on blockchain implementation in the banking sector, Indian daily newspaper the Financial Express reported on Tuesday, Jan. 22.

IDRBT was established by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in 1996 in order to conduct research and experiments in the banking sector.

The organization is reportedly working with the Indian government, banks and industry players to build an interoperable blockchain platform.

Since there is no relevant regulation for the blockchain sphere in India, the blueprint purportedly presents a roadmap on the technology’s adoption in several areas and offers to establish protocols that would allow financial institutions to interact via decentralized platforms.

Former RBI Deputy Governor R Gandhi said that the banking and financial sector is vulnerable to more cybersecurity risks due to the “increased use of rapidly evolving, sophisticated, and complex technologies… increased use of mobile technologies by customers, including the rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the heightened cross-border information security threats.”

While RBI formally stopped all banks from dealing with cryptocurrencies in April and a government panel reportedly considered a complete ban, the RBI considered plans to launch a rupee-pegged digital currency.

Additionally, Indian Digibank allegedly closed several accounts involved with crypto activity, while Kotak Mahindra Bank, India's second largest private sector bank by market cap, reportedly imposed crypto restrictions.
