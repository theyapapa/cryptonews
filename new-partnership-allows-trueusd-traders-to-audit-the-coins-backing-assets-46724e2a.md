# New Partnership Allows TrueUSD Traders to Audit The Coin’s Backing Assets ...

A new partnership between stablecoin TrueUSD (TUSD) and accounting firm Armanino purportedly allows traders to conduct instant audits of the token’s backing.

The dashboard developed by Armanino purportedly enables traders to monitor TrueUSD token balances and collateralized funds.

“Armanino connects directly to third-party escrow accounts holding the U.S. dollars that collateralize TrueUSD tokens, and runs their own ETH nodes to ensure accurate TUSD token supply,” the post details.

Rafael Cosman, Co-founder and Head of Engineering and Product at TrustToken, said that “with real-time confirmation of funds provided by one of the world’s leading accounting firms, traders will know at all times that their tokens are backed by real-world value.”

The move by TrueUSD was taken in a bid to bring more transparency to stablecoins, as there have been doubts that some stablecoins actually have enough fiat in reserve to redeem all tokens with the backing assets, should the need arise.

Last year, stablecoin Tether (USDT), which is pegged to U.S. dollar, fell under scrutiny from the cryptocurrency community after it broke its connection with an auditor firm before the official audit was released.

Without an audit, it could not be proven that Tether in fact has enough reserves, or that they are not being used for something besides backing Tether tokens.
