# The Bug Bounty Program for Facebook’s Libra Is Now Open to the Public ...

###### 2019-08-27 10:08

The Libra Association has opened its bug bounty program to the public to address security concerns in advance of Libra’s anticipated 2020 launch.

The post emphasized that the expansion of the program would promote values critical to the Libra Association like “openness, transparency, and global access,” and ensure minimal issues come launch date.

The association wrote that it expects opening the bug bounty program up to the public will encourage “many more people with diverse skills and backgrounds” to test the security of Libra’s blockchain.

## A stitch in time

Another Aug. 27 blog post on Libra’s website by Michael Engle, head of developer ecosystem at the Libra Association, said that participants can earn up to $10,000 for uncovering critical security issues.

## Regulatory woes

Noteworthy is that Libra’s official announcement of the bug bounty program makes no mention of Facebook, the organization many see as spearheading the Libra Association.

Partially in response to such concerns, David Marcus attempted to reassure the public that “Facebook will only be one among over a hundred members of the Libra Association by launch.”

Regulatory and security concerns have been at the forefront of Libra and Facebook’s efforts to launch their new digital currency.
