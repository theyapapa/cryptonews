CoinShedule’s data states that last month $291.6 million have was raised through ICOs, which is around 19 times less than the $5.8 billion raised in March last year.

Furthermore, according to the data reported on the website, at press time at least 63 ICOs are currently live, and another 18 are upcoming.

A recent Bloomberg report also notes that “while many ICOs used to be launched from the United States, an increasing number are taking place elsewhere, such as in Switzerland.

According to a recent ICObench report, ICOs in Q4 2018 raised 25 percent less than in Q3, while the total amount of completed ICOs increased.

By mid-January 2019, ICOs managed to raise about 33 percent of the combined amount raised in the previous month of December, raising around $160 million.

Per ICObench, the number of ICO listings continued to decline through January.
