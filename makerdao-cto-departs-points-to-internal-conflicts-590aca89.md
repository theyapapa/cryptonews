# MakerDAO CTO Departs, Points to Internal Conflicts ...

###### 2019-04-28 16:04

Andy Milenius, formerly the chief technology officer at MakerDAO, published an open letter dated April 3 explaining his concerns over the project’s internal conflicts.

MakerDAO is the company behind the decentralized algorithmic Ethereum-based stablecoin DAI as well as the governance token Maker (MKR).

In his 24-page-long letter, Milenius describes a conflict between his ideas of equal workspace and democratization true to a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) and his fellow executives’ desire for a traditional corporate efficiency.

The text accuses Rune Christensen, the CEO of the company, of having tried to take control over the DAO, causing the project’s core developers to become uncollaborative.

The letter also illustrates how at one point Milenius intimated to Christensen that if Matt Richards, at the time the president and chief operating officer of the company, wouldn’t leave, then Milenius would.

Millenius confirmed to Cointelegraph today, April 28, that the letter was in fact authored by him and that he is no longer the CTO of MakerDAO.

Richards also complained that, according to him, Milenius thought that no accountability was acceptable and that he didn’t pay attention to MKR token holders’ interest.
