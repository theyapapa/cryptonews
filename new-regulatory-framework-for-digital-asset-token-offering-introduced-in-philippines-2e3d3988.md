# New Regulatory Framework for Digital Asset Token Offering Introduced in Philippines ...

###### 2019-02-05 18:02

The Philippines has introduced a new set of rules governing Digital Asset Token Offering (DATO), according to a press release published by the Asia Blockchain and Crypto Association (ABACA) on Feb. 4.

The new regulations released by the country’s Cagayan Economic Zone Authority (CEZA) are reportedly designed to regulate the cryptocurrency industry and protect investors, affecting such issues as the acquisition of crypto assets, including utility and security tokens.

The rules are divided into tiers, wherein tier one involves investments and assets not exceeding $5 million made in digital tokens; tier two covers the $6–$10 million range, and tier three pertains to investments and assets exceeding $10 million.

CEZA administrator and Chief Executive Officer Raul Lambino reportedly commented on the newly introduced framework:

"It is our goal to provide a clear set of rules and guidelines that will foster innovation yet ensure proper compliance by actors in the ecosystem.

Though the release does not mention the initial coin offering (ICO) regulation the Philippines major financial watchdog Securities and Exchange Commission (PSEC) has been talking about for a while, the new rules could represent a step in that direction.

The PSEC initially issued a set of draft rules for regulating ICOs for public review in August, 2018.

However, in the beginning of 2019, the PSEC claimed it is not ready to issue final ICO regulation, attributing the delay of the release to a request by different stakeholders for further time to look at the draft ICO rules.
