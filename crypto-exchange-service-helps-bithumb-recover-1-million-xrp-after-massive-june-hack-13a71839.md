Hong Kong-based crypto exchange service Changelly has announced that it helped South Korean exchange platform Bithumb recover 1,063,500 Ripple (XRP) in stolen assets following a massive hack in June, a press-release stated, Oct. 26.

In June 2018, hackers attacked South Koreaâ€™s leading crypto exchange Bithumb.

Bithumb initially lost over $30 million worth of cryptocurrencies due to the hack.

Four months after the incident, Bithumb recovered approximately $14 million in stolen digital assets after it collaborated with global counterparts.

According to Ilya Bere, CEO of Changelly, the service quickly cooperated with Bithumb and the South Korean police to offer its help.

The Bithumb hack is one of the largest of 2018 so far, with the price of Bitcoin (BTC) dropping by $200 soon after.

The incident is only surpassed by the attack on Japanese exchange Zaif, which resulted in the theft of around $59 million worth of cryptocurrencies in September.
