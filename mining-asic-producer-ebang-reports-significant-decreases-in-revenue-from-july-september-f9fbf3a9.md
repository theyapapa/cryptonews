Ebang, a crypto mining ASIC hardware producer, has suffered “significant decreases” in revenue in the second half of 2018.

HKEX only requires the financial period reported by IPO applicants not to end more than six months from the day of the listing document.

Following this requirement, Ebang included its financial information until the end of June 2018 in the draft documents submitted to launch its IPO.

According to the data contained in the document, Ebang saw 2.1 billion yuan ($30 billion) in revenue for the first six months of this year.

In the document, Ebang then notes a generally positive outlook to the future, predicting an increase in revenue at year’s end as compared to 2017:

“Nonetheless, our Directors expect that we will continue to record stronger results of operations as a whole for the full year ending December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.”

This is not the first time Ebang has tried to launch an Initial Public Offering (IPO), as the company’s first application from June has reportedly lapsed.

As well, Cointelegraph reported in December that the Hong Kong Stock Exchange is purportedly also reluctant to accept the IPO of leading mining hardware producer Bitmain.
