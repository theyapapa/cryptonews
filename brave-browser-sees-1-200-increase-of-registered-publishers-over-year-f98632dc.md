The number of publishers using the blockchain-based decentralized browser Brave has increased by 1,200% over the past year, industry-focused news outlet Decrypt reported on Aug. 11.

According to data from BATGrowth — a website that monitors Brave browser adoption — the number of Brave Rewards publishers were 18,931 in July, 2018, while its current number is more than 230,000 at press time.

29,278 website publishers including the Washington Post and Smithsonian Magazine, 17,417 Twitter publishers, 2,917 Reddit publishers, 166,698 YouTube publishers and over 12,000 Twitch publishers use the Brave Reward program.

Earlier in August, Brave announced a feature for tipping content creators on Twitter with its native Basic Attention Tokens (BAT).

Last month, news broke that users of the last nightly (in-development) version of Brave are now able to withdraw their BAT tokens after verifying their identity with crypto banking startup UpHold.

After the verification, users will reportedly be able to buy additional BAT tokens, in case they wish to contribute to website maintenance and content creation.

At press time, BAT is trading at around $0.201, down 2.76% over the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.
