Blockchain-based internet browser Brave has continued expanding its crypto tipping option by integrating it into Reddit and Vimeo.

## Reddit and Vimeo follow Twitter

Announced on Twitter on Aug. 21, a new version of Brave Browser enables users to tip on ad-free video platform Vimeo and social news site Reddit, using Brave’s native Basic Attention Token (BAT).

The tipping feature on Reddit and Vimeo comes weeks after it was first introduced on social media network Twitter following a successful service trial on its testing browser Brave Nightly.

Brave initially introduced Reddit and Vimeo tipping as part of the browser’s developer preview earlier this summer, according to a post on Reddit published a month ago.

## Previous tipping efforts on Reddit and Vimeo

Brave’s initiative to introduce a tipping option on Reddit and Vimeo is not the first attempt to allow users of the platforms to tip for content.

In 2013, Reddit initiated a content tipping option in Bitcoin through the bitcointip bot.
