More than a third of German logistics managers believe that blockchain technology has the potential to significantly improve cooperation in supply chains, according to a Hermes survey published Nov. 12.

The survey polled participants on which technologies they believed were important for improving cooperation within the supply chain.

In larger companies — specifically in companies with more than 250 employees — the estimate is even higher, with half of all the managers noting blockchain technology’s potential in the industry.

More than half of respondents from larger companies believe that blockchain technology is increasingly important for improving data security in the collaboration process.

One third of logistics managers from small companies expect the technology to be a valid security improvement.

Knowledge about blockchain technology is scarcer in smaller companies.

42 percent of the managers from bigger companies have researched the technology, while only 21 percent of all respondents have done the same.
