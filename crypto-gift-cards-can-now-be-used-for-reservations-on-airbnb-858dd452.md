Digital gift cards and mobile phone refill provider Bitrefill has added an option to make Airbnb reservations with cryptocurrency, Bitrefill announced in al tweet on March 27.

The card is technically a voucher product, meaning that customers purchase a U.S. dollar equivalent for Airbnb with cryptocurrencies and subsequently receive a voucher code to use on the platform.

In February, Cointelegraph reported that Argentinian state public transport card SUBE (Sistema Único de Boleto Electrónico) can now be topped up using Bitcoin.

Last August, the state government of the Australian province of Queensland announced it would issue a grant to a cryptocurrency startup as part of over $8.3 million of innovation funding.

The company would purportedly boost tourism to the state by selling travel offers with cryptocurrencies.

Conversely, In June of last year major travel booking website Expedia.com stopped accepting Bitcoin as a payment method for hotels or flights, however the service did not comment on the cancellation either on social media or on its website at the time.

Expedia first announced it would accept Bitcoin as a form of payment in June, 2014, when it teamed up with leading crypto exchange Coinbase.
