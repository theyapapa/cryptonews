## Bitcoin simmers after latest $11K moonshot

Data from Coin360 showed less volatile action for BTC/USD on Thursday, following the pair’s sudden rise of over $1,000 in the first half of the week.

At press time, Bitcoin traded at $10,620, compared with just $9,350 at the same point last week.

“Bitcoin continues to consolidate above $10k,” he summarized in private comments, adding:

“A lot of people are hoping to get bids filled below $9k; the market rarely gets what it wants and I wouldn’t be surprised if they are forced to buy higher.

While opinions suggest demand for Bakkt’s physical Bitcoin futures will be high, activity has yet to kick off, with client deposits beginning on Friday this week.

## Altcoins continue to bite the dust

Bitcoin’s latest consolidation meanwhile continues to pile pressure on altcoin markets.

As trader Nick Cote warned on Thursday, a further dip below $160 could even have a knock-on effect for Bitcoin.

Bitcoin’s share of the $267 billion crypto market cap stood at 71% on Thursday, continuing to expand on highs not seen in over two years.
