The Cointelegraph Analytics team have released a summary of the most anticipated upcoming events for major coins including EOS, Tron (TRX) and Neo (NEO).

## EOS to have its first hard fork on Sept. 23

EOS, the seventh-biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, is expected to have its first consensus upgrade on Sept. 23, as EOS block producers (BPs) have agreed to activate EOSIO v1.8 on the EOS mainnet on this date.

According to EOS Nation, a major BP, the upcoming event is the largest upgrade to the EOS network since it was launched.

It is also the first update to require a hard fork, which is a split of the source blockchain into two separate networks that will have their own transaction histories.

As noted by Cointelegraph Analytics, apart from small improvements in security and scalability, EOSIO developer company Block.one has reportedly simplified the operation of future hard forks.

## Tron to update the Sun Network

According to Cointelegraph Analytics, Tron is soon expected to release an update for the Sun Network that was officially launched on Aug. 11.

Cointelegraph Analytics notes that the current version of the Neo blockchain is only receiving bug fixes and has the simplest set of features, while the NEO 3.0 upgrade will have a number of improvements.
