Patrick Byrne, founder and CEO of U.S. retail giant Overstock, is planning to sell the retail arm of his company to focus on blockchain by early next year, The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reports Nov. 23.

The WSJ reports that Byrne has been planning to sell his e-commerce business since 2017 to fully devote himself to blockchain projects.

According to WSJ, Overstock’s blockchain-focused subsidiary Medici Ventures is the cause of visible losses for the company.

Overstock was launched back in 1999 to sell surplus and returned merchandise online and became a “pioneer” in the crypto space by becoming one of the first major companies to accept Bitcoin (BTC) in 2014.

According to WSJ, a remote blockchain-driven voting in U.S. state of West Virginia was among the projects that Medici backed this year.

Another project supported by Overstock’s blockchain division is a land registry platform in Zambia.
