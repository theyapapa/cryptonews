# How Security Tokens Can Prevent an Impending Financial Crisis ...

An investigation of the systemic weaknesses that led to the crisis points to the promise of a new financial instrument that has entered the market — tokenized securities.

## Security tokens

Security tokens serve as digital representations of any other tradable financial asset, including equity shares of companies, interests in funds, contracts entitled to a specific slice of future revenue streams, ownership of intellectual property, fractional ownership of real estate and other physical assets, and derivatives themselves.

As we reflect on the 10-year anniversary of the 2008 crisis and try to understand the disruption to global supply chains in a new environment of trade wars, it is important to analyze the fundamental problems that led us down this path of economic turmoil and why security tokens can help stave off future financial disasters.

In addition, a lack of liquidity in private securities markets made it difficult to rebalance or break up portfolios by selling smaller positions to a wider pool of potential buyers — or even by selling individual assets.

## The next phase

To combat the issues that led to the 2008 global financial crisis, the adoption of security tokens becomes mission-critical.

Many analysts predict that the majority of financial products will one day be traded on the blockchain as security tokens, with programmable smart contracts — and for good reason: Only security tokens can bring greater transparency, oversight, access and liquidity to the market.

Here are the chief benefits of security tokens and the issues they help modify:

- Portfolio transparency: Unlike the 2008 RMBS portfolios, security token offerings provide investors with direct, real-time software driven access to portfolios and underlying financial assets.
