## Parking space data for digital currency

Forbes reported the news on Aug. 29.

The new app relies on Continentalâ€™s blockchain-based Data Monetization Platform (DMP).

According to the report, the company has been testing the program in Ireland, which allows users to receive IOTA cryptocurrency in return for sharing data.

As reported earlier today by Cointelegraph, Jaguar Land Rover and Iota are performing a demo of a new distributed ledger technology for tracking and sharing energy data.

In addition to providing data on how much energy the Jaguar I-Pace uses, the platform also tracks the origins of the energy and can ensure that it originates from sustainable sources.

## Blockchain-based data monetization in the home

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, the Energy network company E.On filed a patent application for a blockchain-based information collector that could be used for data monetization.

The device would reportedly use sensors to collect user data from smart home applications, which users could then selectively sell to third parties.
