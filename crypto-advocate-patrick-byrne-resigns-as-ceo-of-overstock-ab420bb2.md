Noted crypto advocate Patrick Byrne resigns as CEO of Overstock.

Per a letter of resignation and company statement posted on Twitter Aug. 22, Patrick Byrn will be stepping down as CEO of Overstock.

Having led crypto-friendly e-commerce at the company, including the launch of tZero, Overstock’s crypto token platform, and Overstock’s acceptance of Bitcoin payment, Byrne’s announcement follows the announcement of disappointing Q1 earnings for 2019.

More directly, Byrne cited the recent announcement of his controversial relationship with Maria Butina as the impetus for cutting ties with Overstock.

However, it is questionable to what degree this faith will direct Overstock’s future in Byrne’s absence.

Per an Overstock press release issued later on Aug. 22, Jonathan Johnson will fill Byrne’s shoes as CEO on an interim basis, while Kamelia Aryafar will take Byrne’s place as board member and executive vice president of Overstock Retail.

In September of last year, Cointelegraph reported on Byrne’s sale of over $20 million of stock in Overstock, in response to which he assured the public “don't worry, I'm still in the game.”
