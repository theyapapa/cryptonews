Hybrid blockchain solutions startup Kadena has updated its enterprise blockchain platform on the Microsoft Azure Marketplace.

On Aug. 27, Kadena announced that its new product called Kadena Scalable Permissioned Blockchain is available on Azure Marketplace for free.

## Blockchain scalability ambitions

Founded by former blockchain experts at United States banking giant JPMorgan, Kadena first released its permissioned blockchain on the Amazon Web Services Marketplace in January 2019.

## Private chain for enterprise use

Kadena’s upgraded enterprise blockchain platform supports up to four nodes and 2,000 transactions per second, according to the announcement.

Will Martino, Kadena’s co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch that the recent launch of their enterprise blockchain product on Azure builds on the success of last year’s endeavor involving AWS.

And by bringing that chain to AWS marketplace, and now to Microsoft Azure, we are servicing almost all of the enterprise blockchain market that takes place in the cloud.”

Co-founded by Popejoy and Martino — both of whom worked at JPMorgan on early blockchain projects before launching Kadena in 2016 — Kadena has raised $14.9 million so far, according to the TechCrunch report.
