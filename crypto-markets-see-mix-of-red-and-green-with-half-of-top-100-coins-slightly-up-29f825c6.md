Ripple (XRP) is also seeing growth, sitting at the largest daily gains among the 20 top coins.

Earlier this week, Ripple was reported to lead a group of crypto and blockchain startups that are going to lobby the U.S. lawmakers and financial regulators to support innovation for the industry.

Total market cap has increased slightly, currently at $223 billion and up about $2 billion since the same time yesterday.

As crypto prices remain fairly volatile and without a clear trend, a group of lawmakers from the U.S. Congress has recently addressed the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), asking it to provide more regulatory clarity for the crypto industry.

Anthony Pompliano, founder and partner at Morgan Creek Digital Assets, has summarized the main crypto industry events of the week in his tweet September 30.

The industry expert has highlighted such events as the crypto mining giant Bitmain filing for an initial public offering (IPO) on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the partial reversal of Googleâ€™s crypto ad ban, and the upcoming launch of a stable cryptocurrency (stablecoin) by the peer-to-peer payments company Circle.
