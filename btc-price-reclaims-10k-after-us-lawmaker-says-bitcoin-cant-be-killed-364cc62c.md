But the ongoing scrutiny of Facebook’s Libra project in Washington D.C. appears to be educating lawmakers about the key differences between Bitcoin and other so-called “cryptocurrencies.”

As reported by Cointelegraph, Blockstream chief strategy officer Samson Mow suggested that Facebook should have simply offered a BTC service instead of foraying into a new cryptocurrency with Libra.

## U.S. representative says ‘there's no capacity to kill bitcoin’

Meanwhile, U.S. representative Patrick McHenry said that he believes Bitcoin (BTC) can not be killed in an interview with CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on July 17.

During the interview — when he was asked whether he believes politicians will allow cryptocurrencies to thrive — McHenry said:

“I think there’s no capacity to kill Bitcoin.

McHenry also pointed out that newer cryptocurrencies, backed by startups or corporations, are trying to replicate the success of Bitcoin’s decentralized, open-access network.

He concluded:

“The essence of Bitcoin is what Libra and Facebook, and corporates are trying to mimic.”

As Cointelegraph reported, the United States’ Senate Banking Committee raised a wave skepticism over Facebook’s crypto project Libra during the first day of testimony on July 16.
