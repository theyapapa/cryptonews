Bitcoin’s (BTC) best-known names are currently playing a guessing game after one of the industry’s most controversial Twitter accounts changed its views overnight.

## @Bitcoin switches from Bitcoin.com to Bitcoin.org

Multiple users, including Reddit’s r/Bitcoin Subreddit moderator, BashCo, are supplying theories to explain the behaviour of the @Bitcoin account.

Instead of promoting Bitcoin, the account has long maligned it in favor of altcoin Bitcoin Cash (BCH) after allegedly falling into the hands of major proponent, Roger Ver.

As of press time Aug. 20, @Bitcoin redirects to pro-BTC website Bitcoin.org, instead of Ver’s Bitcoin.com

Ver denied any involvement with the account last year, while suggesting he knew its real owner.

After that Reddit exchange, in a post @Bitcoin subsequently retweeted Tuesday, Autonomous Bitcoin AI #2357 provided another explanation involving Ver.

“I have no proof of this, but I think the owner of @bitcoin must have had a romantic relationship with Roger Ver and recently broke up with Roger.

While Bitcoin has risen from the ashes this year, BCH has failed to do the same, currently trading at all-time lows in BTC terms.
