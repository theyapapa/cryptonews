# Centralized Exchanges Still Overwhelmingly Dominate Market, New Report Shows ...

Despite a significant uptick in the creation of decentralized crypto exchanges (DEX) in 2018, their centralized counterparts continue to control the lion’s share of global industry trade volumes.

TokenInsight’s report, which has reportedly analyzed data from over 400 global crypto exchanges, indicates that DEX account for just 19 percent of the global exchange ecosystem.

Further, the trading volumes on DEX amount to less than 1 percent of those on centralized exchanges.

The low figures come despite TokenInsight’s analysis that DEX platforms gained significant industry traction in 2018.

The report underscores that whereas centralized platforms “are challenged by problems of opaque trading rules, intransparent fund storage and security,” DEX offer “deal-matching and asset liquidation realized through smart contracts,” and allow users’ funds to remain under their own control.

In light of a number of high-profile centralized exchange hacks last year, the report argues that the industry is also increasingly recognizing the security benefits of the DEX model.

After Q3 2018, however, DEX trading volumes declined significantly — a downturn that TokenInsight attributes to the impact of the bear market.
