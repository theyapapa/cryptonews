Major global online payments system PayPal has launched a blockchain-based reward system for its employees.

Financial news channel Cheddar reported on the platform launch Thursday, Dec. 6, citing PayPal’s director of innovation Michael Todasco.

According to Cheddar, the program was prepared by PayPal’s innovation team, which is based in San Jose, California, over a six-month period and was launched in mid-November.

Employees using the program are granted tokens for participating in innovation-related programs and contributing ideas.

These tokens are only valid within PayPal and can be traded among the participants of the program via “public ledger.”

On the website designed for the token program, employees “can like and comment on and see all the activity going on within PayPal related to innovation,” Todasco explained.

PayPal, which has been exploring blockchain for two years already, is also interested in crypto payments.
