# Bank of America Has the Most Blockchain Patents, But Is It Actually Going to Use Them? ...

## Brief history of BofA’s filing crypto-related patents

The bank filed its first blockchain-related patent back in March 2014, and it was published by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) — the agency that awards copyrights on inventions in the country — in September 2015.

In September 2015, the same month BofA was awarded with a crypto-related patent, the financial institution joined R3, a consortium of over 200 members, including various banks, trade associations, and fintech companies, who work towards developing blockchain solutions.

Eventually, BofA secured the first place in an unofficial patent race — by June 2018, the institution held around 45 live patents (meaning that they are active and have not expired), the largest amount among all companies, according to research from Marc Kaufman, an attorney co-chairing the Blockchain Intellectual Property Council at the U.S. Chamber of Digital Commerce.

## BofA’s latest patent filings: from private keys storage to cryptocurrency exchange system

Here are some details of BofA’s blockchain efforts published by the USPTO within the past year.

That should provide a clearer picture of how the bank plans on using the technology, at least hypothetically:

## Private keys

BofA’s most recent cryptocurrency-related patent award, which was confirmed on October 30, references storage methods for private keys.

## Data storage

In April, the bank’s application for a patent on a blockchain-based storage system with automated data authentication was unveiled.

The patent addresses the problem of data transferring and tracking, which it says can be resolved by means of cryptographic keys in a private blockchain:

“Embodiments of the invention utilize a private blockchain to store various types of records to be conveyed to the service providers.
