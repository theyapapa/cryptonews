Daiwa Securities Group, Japan’s second largest securities brokerage, has announced the completion of a blockchain proof-of-concept (PoC) in a press release shared with Cointelegraph on Feb. 19.

The PoC implemented blockchain in the trade matching of post-trade processing.

The blockchain pilot project, dubbed “JPX Proof-of-Concept Testing for Utilization of Blockchain / DLT in Capital Market Infrastructure,” involved 26 companies, including financial institutions, system providers and institutional investors.

The reported goal of the pilot — which just completed the second of two phases — was to increase the efficiency of blockchain tech in the post-trade process.

According to the results of the pilot, the implementation of standardized specifications and workflow processes for the blockchain system is expected to reduce operational costs and allow for easier development of new products and services.

The press release also notes that to implement a standardized system via blockchain to a wide range of companies will require more practical considerations.

As Cointelegraph reported yesterday, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, Japan’s second-largest bank by assets, conducted a PoC using blockchain consortium R3’s Marco Polo trade finance platform.
