Former blockchain firm ConsenSys’ ventures head Kavita Gupta joined security token project Dusk Network.

As industry news outlet The Block reported on Aug. 30, Gupta joined Dusk Network, an Amsterdam-based startup trying to help companies tokenize their equity shares.

## Fundraising for private companies

Gupta, who worked at McKinsey, HSBC, and the World Bank, believes that Security Token Offerings (STOs) can address various impediments that keep private companies from tapping into public markets.

Per the report, STOs provide a way for companies to maintain control while also raising capital by selling fewer shares, compared to a public listing.

Gupta explained:

“A lot of companies in Silicon Valley keep on pushing IPOs because the founders want to keep control.

According to Gupta, STOs allow companies to determine the right price for the IPO.

For a lot of companies they might not even go through IPOs.”
