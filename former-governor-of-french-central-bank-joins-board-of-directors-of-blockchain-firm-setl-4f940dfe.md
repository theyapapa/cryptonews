Noyer’s professional experience includes serving as Vice President of the European Central Bank, Governor of the Banque de France between November 2003 and October 2015, as well as service at the Treasury in the French Ministry of the Economy and Finance.

Previously, Setl’s board of directors was joined by such heavyweights as former non-executive member of the Court of the Bank of England Sir David Walker, former Senior Information Risk Owner of the United Kingdom Foreign and Commonwealth Office Martin Clements, and former Bank of England Deputy Governor Rachel Lomax.
