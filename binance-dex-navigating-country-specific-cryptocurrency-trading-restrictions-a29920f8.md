Traders from the U.S. and 28 other countries will, as of July 1, 2019, be unable to access the Binance DEX platform via its website — Binance.org.

With the impending restriction, Binance has advised traders in the 29 countries to consider using wallet apps that support access to the DEX without having to go through the website.
