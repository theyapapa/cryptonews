Following a recent hard fork of Bitcoin SV (BSV), the network saw a three-chain split after a massive 210 megabytes (MB) block was mined.

As reported by BitMEX Research on Aug. 3, Bitcoin SV nodes divided into three groups on Saturday, making the network to split into three separate chains.

According to the report, 65% of nodes were located on the current tip, while 17% were stuck on the 210 MB block and 19% had not even upgraded and were on the old pre-hard fork chain.

Bitcoin SV, a hard fork of Bitcoin Cash (BCH), which is in turn a fork of the major cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC), successfully ran its own scheduled hard fork on July 24 as part of plans to increase its block size from the previously set limit of 128 MB up to 2 gigabytes.

## Bitcoin SV nodes are getting expensive

Prior to the three-chain split, Ryan X. Charles, a BSV supporter and CEO of BSV-powered payment system MoneyButton, published a post on the Money Button blog about his issues running a BSV node.

Specifically, Charles stated that Money Button went down for three hours because their Bitcoin SV node ran out of memory and crashed during a stress test.

According to tech news outlet TrustNodes, Coin Dance service is now on the new Bitcoin SV chain, while the older chain will likely be discarded.
