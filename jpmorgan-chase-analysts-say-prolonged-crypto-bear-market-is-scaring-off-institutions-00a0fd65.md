Analysts from global investment bank JPMorgan Chase believe that the protracted crypto bear market is driving away institutional investors, Bloomberg reports on Tuesday, Dec. 18.

Analysts from JPMorgan, along with global market strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, have reportedly stated that involvement of institutional investors in Bitcoin (BTC) “appears to be fading.”

In a jointly released research note, analysts have concluded that “key flow metrics have downshifted dramatically,” including a decline in the Bitcoin futures market.

The experts reportedly noted the decreasing index of open interest (OI) — the amount of open contracts on Bitcoin futures — on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) global markets.

Moreover, JPMorgan reportedly stated that the average transaction size in the crypto market has dropped to lower than $160, opposed to about $5,000 one year ago.

The research note also touched on the issue of the crash of crypto mining profitability that is associated with the overall decline of crypto markets.

Yesterday, crypto research firm Diar published an analysis claiming that institutional investors have turned to higher liquidity over-the-counter (OTC) physical Bitcoin trading.
