India’s authorities have expressed concern over Facebook’s forthcoming stablecoin Libra, Bloomberg reported on July 8.

Subhash Garg, Economic Affairs Secretary at India’s Ministry of Finance, told Bloomberg that the “design of the Facebook currency has not been fully explained.

Facebook’s Libra is set to be a stablecoin pegged to a reserve of assets which would purportedly preclude the coin from volatility.

However, a ban on Libra in India could mean that the country, home to the second-largest unbanked population in the world and 260 million Facebook users, misses out when Libra launches in the first half of next year.

As previously reported, Facebook has not applied for approval with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to operate its digital currency in the country, which makes it unavailable in India due to the current ban of blockchain-based currency transactions.

At the time, Anirudh Rastogi, founder at local tech-focused law firm Ikigai Law, suggested that the RBI would not be concerned about Facebook’s Libra if the project was operating in a closed peer-to-peer system.

India is currently the largest remittance-receiving country in the world, with top remittances amounting to $79 billion in 2018, according to the World Bank.
