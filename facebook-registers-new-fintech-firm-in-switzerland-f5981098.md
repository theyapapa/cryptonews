# Facebook Registers New Fintech Firm in Switzerland ...

###### 2019-05-17 15:05

Social media giant Facebook has apparently formed a new financial tech firm, Libra Networks LLC, according to a filing on the Geneva Commercial Register.

Libra Networks was registered in Geneva on May 2 by Facebook Global Holdings II LLC.

Facebook registered the trademark “Libra” with the United States Patent and Trademark Office back in June, which was reportedly part of its secretretive in-house crypto project.

Facebook has also hired two cryptocurrency compliance experts who formerly worked at the major crypto exchange Coinbase as reported by Cointelegraph in May.

At the recent crypto conference Consensus 2019, Polychain Capital CEO Olaf Carlson-Wee commented that he thinks the rumored stablecoin should be built on a public, open source infrastructure.

Carlson-Wee thinks it would be in the self-interest of the company given recent controversies surrounding the social media platform:

“I think given all the problems that Facebook has had with policing their platform and things like that, I think that the strategic move for Facebook would actually be to build public infrastructure.

And that public infrastructure could be incorporated onto all the Facebook platforms, which of course are proprietary.
