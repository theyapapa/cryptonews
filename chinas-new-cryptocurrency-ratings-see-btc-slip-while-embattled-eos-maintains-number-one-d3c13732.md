China has released its latest government-sponsored rankings of major cryptocurrencies, placing Bitcoin (BTC) in 18th while awarding the top spot to domestic blockchain platform EOS (EOS).

China’s Center for Information and Industry Development (CCID) under the Country's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology creates the rankings, which first appeared in May this year.

Now listing a total of 34 top cryptocurrencies by market cap on the premise of “basic tech,” “applicability” and “creativity,” the results have frequently courted controversy, especially with regard to Bitcoin’s consistently average ranking.

EOS began ranking top in June.

Completing its eighth issue, the CCID maintained EOS’ pole position, with Ethereum (ETH) coming in second.

“Public blockchains with high performance and support for general application development are generally ranked high,” the CCID wrote in accompanying comments, continuing:

“Among the top 10, four public chains adopted graphene architecture with better performance, six public chains use the dPOS consensus mechanism, and seven public chains support Dapp development.”

The rankings meanwhile awarded seventh place to BitShares (BTS), a project which shares the same creator as EOS, Daniel Larimer.
