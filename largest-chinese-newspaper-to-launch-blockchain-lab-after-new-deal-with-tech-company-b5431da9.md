The venture capital wing of the official newspaper of the Communist Party of China (CCP) — People’s Daily Online — has signed a deal for a strategic partnership on a blockchain laboratory Oct. 23, according to a press release.

People’s Capital signed a deal with Shenzhen-based technology company Xunlei Limited.

Per the terms of the agreement, the two companies will construct a laboratory for “technology innovation” at the People Capital’s Blockchain Research Institute.

According to the press release, the blockchain laboratory is part of an initial global partnership agreement signed by People’s Daily Online and Xunlei Limited on July 22 of this year.

The People’s Daily Online is the online version of the People’s Daily, which was founded in 1948.

Earlier this year, the CCP published a primer on blockchain technology and its possible applications.

Ye Zhenzhen, general manager of the People's Daily then stated that the most important part of blockchain technology is its “operating mechanism.”
