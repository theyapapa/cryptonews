Bitcoin (BTC) is down a little under percent on the day, and is trading at $6,470 as of press time.

With one notable exception Oct. 15 – a brief spike correlated with Tether’s slight untethering from its dollar peg – the top coin has been trading sideways between $6,500-$6,500 for the past few days, before slipping below the $6,500 today, still above where it started the week, close to $6,300.

The market’s top altcoin Ethereum (ETH) is trading at a round $200 as of press time, seeing a negligible price change of just a fraction of a percent on the day.

The second crypto by market cap saw a similarly sharp spike to Bitcoin on Oct. 15, reaching over $220, but has since corrected to trade range-bound between $205-210 over recent days, only just dipping to as low as $202 earlier today.

Yet more stablecoin news continues to break as the week ends, with third largest cryptocurrency exchange Huobi announcing the creation of what it calls its own native “stablecoin solution,” HUSD, which has been designed to help manage the four other USD-backed stablecoins currently listed on the exchange – (Paxos Standard (PAX), True USD (TUSD), USD Coin (USDC) and Gemini Dollars (GUSD).
