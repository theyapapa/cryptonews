11% of the American population owns the major cryptocurrency bitcoin (BTC), according to a new survey published by Spencer Bogart of venture capital firm Blockchain Capital on April 30.

Blockchain Capital partner Bogart today posted the results of a new survey conducted by Harris Poll in order to provide analytics data on bitcoin’s demographic trends.

Conducted between April 23, 2019 and April 25, 2019, the survey included answers of 2,052 American adults and represents an expanded version of the previous demographic survey released by the firm in October 2017.

According to the survey results, the American population gained more knowledge about bitcoin in terms of six key aspects: awareness, familiarity, perception, conviction, propensity to purchase and ownership.

The 45-54 and 55-64 age ranges indicated an equal ownership amounting to 5%, with 2% of American retirees over 65 years claimed to hold the biggest cryptocurrency.
