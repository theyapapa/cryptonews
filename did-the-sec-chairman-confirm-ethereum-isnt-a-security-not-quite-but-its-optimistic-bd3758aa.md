# Did the SEC Chairman Confirm Ethereum Isn’t a Security? Not Quite, but It’s Optimistic ...

Ethereum is most likely not a security under existing United States laws, as previously said by U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Division of Corporate Finance head William Hinman.

Clayton said that he agrees with Hinman’s explanation on the point in which a token can no longer be accurately characterized as a security but did not directly and conclusively state that Ethereum is not a security under existing laws, Santori explained:

“Clayton didn't say that ‘Ether is no longer a security.’

Although Santori said that he does not think Ethereum is a security — and so did other industry executives and regulators, including Hinman — there is a gap between an SEC official offering his thoughts on the regulatory nature of the SEC and the chairman of the commission stating it to Congress.

Clayton’s recent statement, which could be viewed as a positive step toward cryptocurrency and ICO regulation, does not provide enough clarity on the regulatory nature of most tokens and does not definitively show that Ethereum is not a security.

The state of the ICO market in the U.S. remains more or less similar to the time before Clayton released his statement and the securities laws remain ambiguous for projects.

In late 2018, a bipartisan bill entitled “Token Taxonomy Act of 2018” was introduced, which proposed the exclusion of cryptocurrencies from the securities laws because of the limit in which the laws govern or characterize cryptocurrencies:

“Direct the Securities and Exchange Commission to enact certain regulatory changes regarding digital units secured through public key cryptography, to adjust taxation of virtual currencies held in individual retirement accounts, to create a tax exemption for exchanges of one virtual currency for another, to create a de minimis exemption from taxation for gains realized from the sale or exchange of virtual currency for other than cash, and for other purposes.”

In the foreseeable future, the SEC is expected to go over ICOs and token sales in a case-by-case basis, evaluating whether certain tokens or crypto assets represent potential security transactions within the regulatory framework of the U.S.
