The company behind a multi-asset, universal wallet that can store major crypto and smart contract tokens in one place says it has become the first mobile wallet to support the ADA cryptocurrency.

Infinito Wallet says the milestone coincides with an update to version 1.15.0 of its platform – enabling users to “securely send, receive and check transaction history of ADA.”

With IOHK’s permission and support, Infinito has contributed code to the open-source Cardano Rust project for ADA mobile wallet integration and will continue such support for the Cardano open-source community.

ADA now joins thousands of other tokens on the biggest smart contract platforms — such as ETH, EOS, NEO — together with leading coins, including Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Dash, ETC and Dogecoin, supported by Infinito Wallet.

## Understanding ADA

Infinito Wallet describes the ADA cryptocurrency, which is based on the third-generation Cardano blockchain, as “digital cash that represents the future of money.”

Through the Infinito Wallet app, which is available on Apple’s App Store for iOS devices and Google Play for Android smartphones and tablets, users can check their ADA balance through the dashboard, send the cryptocurrency to any address and review their transaction history.

## More upgrades planned

The company says it plans to launch version 2.0 of its universal wallet in the fourth quarter of this year, and this will be equipped with a new design that offers a higher degree of customization and an enhanced experience for Infinito Wallet’s user base.
