E-cash inventor David Chaum has unveiled yet another cryptocurrency which he says is resistant to quantum computer attacks.

## Chaum plans for quantum armageddon

In a blog post issued Aug. 20, Chaum championed the new offering, Praxxis, which has seen a six-month development process.

The new blockchain follows on from Chaum’s Elixxir project, which debuted in September last year, and is intended to interact closely with its framework.

Chaum is widely recognized as one of the fathers of digital money, while his efforts in recent years have become marked as separate from Bitcoin (BTC) itself.

The focus on quantum resistance follows on from a previous debate about Bitcoin’s overall susceptibility to attacks from the new generation of hardware.

“It is certain that the NSA has already built quantum computers.

’”

Chaum launched Praxxis in a formal setting on Tuesday at the Web3 Summit in Berlin.
