New York-based enterprise software firm R3, known for its enterprise blockchain platform Corda, has doubled the size of its London Wall office.

According to the report, R3 has increased the size of its London branch as partial accommodation for the company’s intended 85 global hires by the end of 2019.

Additionally, the report states that the London expansion is a cornerstone of R3’s rapid growth plans.

According to R3 CEO David E. Rutter, the United Kingdom’s impending departure from the European Union will position London in a favorable economic position:

“There is enormous opportunity for London post-Brexit.

More specifically, R3 has partnered with the banks Bradesco, Itau and B3 stock exchange to build a platform for foreign trade and insurance.

R3 executives apparently shared the news at an R3 Consortium meeting, the members of which are from large banks and tech companies.

The consortium has also said that the Brazilian stock exchange is currently using R3’s signature Corda platform for digital identification.
