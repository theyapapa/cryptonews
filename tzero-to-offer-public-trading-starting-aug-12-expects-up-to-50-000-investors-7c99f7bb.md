Retail giant Overstock’s blockchain subsidiary company, tZERO, plans to allow the public to trade its security tokens in four days.

Noursalehi additionally commented that the company is expecting as many as 50,000 new investors, who have already bought Overstock shares, to begin trading their digital security tokens.

At press time, the report notes that two tokens are available for trading on tZERO’s platform.

The report also notes that tZERO has been offering token trading since January, but the option was only available to accredited investors.

At the time, Noursalehi commented:

“The world of security tokens has lacked a regulated venue for secondary trading.

The trading of our own security tokens is the crossing of the Rubicon for the new world of digital assets.

CEO Noursalehi remarked at the time:

“On the issuance front, Brooke will drive strategic development of our security token ecosystem by focusing on the supply-side of the equation — working with issuers to bring more quality assets to the PRO Securities ATS.
