# Confident in the Future: EOS Developers Attempt 10% Buyback Ahead of Major Announcement ...

###### 2019-05-25 12:05

Earlier this week, it was revealed that EOS developer Block.one is attempting a 10% buyback of its stock, reportedly the second one in less than a year.

As per Bloomberg, this stock repurchase offer comes “less than a year” after the initial buyback, in which Block.one reportedly aimed to acquire 15% of its outstanding shares at $1,200 each, but gathered a total of 13.8% in the end, which equaled around $300 million.

Novogratz’s crypto merchant bank, Galaxy Digital, accepted the offer and sold shares in Block.one for $71.2 million — securing a 123% return on the initial investment.

“We continue to work closely with Block.one as a key partner across a number of our business lines, including the Galaxy EOS VC Fund, which invests in companies building on the EOS.IO protocol, and remain excited about the EOS.IO protocol," the Galaxy Digital CEO said.

The new buyback as well as the “few outward signs of progress since the sale of EOS tokens,” as Bloomberg puts it, raise the question: What is Block.one’s plan, and why does the startup need all that money?

“I guess taking 48% of active Dapp users in market share in its first year is what Alastair interprets as showing ‘Little signs of progress,’” he wrote in the official EOS Telegram group chat, adding:

“Last year’s buyback was to make room for new investors without unnecessarily inflating our balance sheet.

According to Larimer, who also joined the Telegram chat to address investors’ questions regarding the stock repurchase, Block.one couldn’t have chosen to buy EOS tokens instead, because the company cannot own more than 10% of the total supply, which it has already maxed out.
