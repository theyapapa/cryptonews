Cryptocurrency mining is reportedly one of the most observed objectives of hackers attacking businesses’ cloud infrastructures, according to a report by AT&T Cybersecurity on March 14.

The cybersecurity wing of United States telecoms firm AT&T stated that organizations of all sizes continue to face major crypto mining attacks despite the ongoing bear market.

In the new report, AT&T examined the most significant forms of cryptojacking associated with mining attacks on organizations’ cloud infrastructure.

AT&T outlined four major cryptojacking tactics used by hackers such as compromising container management platforms, control panel exploitation, theft of application programming interfaces (APIs), as well as spreading malicious Docker images.

AT&T researchers have found that crypto jackers were using unauthenticated management interfaces and opened APIs to compromise container management platforms for illicit cryptocurrency mining.

In this regard, AT&T cited an attack reported by security vendor RedLock, where an attacker compromised open-source container management system Kubernetes.

After providing a detailed description of hackers’ strategies to mine crypto through cloud structures, AT&T provided a number of recommendations for detecting mining attacks on cloud systems.
