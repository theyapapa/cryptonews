The Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) has appointed blockchain security firm CipherTrace to monitor activity by crypto businesses in Malta, local news agency The Times of Malta reports on March 11.

The United States-based blockchain security company will assist the MFSA in combating money laundering and financing terrorism risks associated with entities involved in crypto businesses.

As previously reported, the MFSA envisions coordinating interactions with crypto-related businesses such as initial coin offering (ICO) operators and crypto exchanges through virtual financial agents (VFA agents).

Bringing a bridge between crypto operators and the islandâ€™s financial regulator, VFA agents can be represented by lawyers, accountants and auditors, which are set to do the due diligence of crypto businesses.

In October 2018, the Times of Malta reported that about two-thirds of VFA agents failed crypto agent certifications, despite examiners easing the test by revising the evaluation scheme.

Once approved, VFA agents will be able to submit applications for operators like crypto exchanges, wallets and ICOs.

CipherTrace CEO Dave Jevans noted that banks often turn away crypto- and blockchain-related business due to a lack of knowledge about their practices.
