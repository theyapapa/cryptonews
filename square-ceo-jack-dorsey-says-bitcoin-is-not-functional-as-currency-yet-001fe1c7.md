Square and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has said Bitcoin (BTC) will continue to be adopted more widely, but it is still too early to consider it a currency.

## Make Bitcoin more usable and accessible as a currency

On Sept. 4, the outspoken Bitcoin advocate told the Australian Financial Review that he is convinced the No. 1 cryptocurrency will continue to be adopted more widely.

However, Dorsey added:

"It's not functional as a currency.

Dorsey, who endorses the principles that created Bitcoin and the community that formed around it, went on to say that once crypto becomes the currency of the internet, Square would focus more on services that add value rather than those that enable money to be moved around.

Dorsey was visiting Melbourne for the launch of the Square Terminal, an all-in-one credit and debit card machine.

## Dorsey loves Bitcoin

As Cointelegraph has previously reported, Square first announced in November 2017 that it would release a BTC trading option which prompted its stock to soar by $1 billion in five days.

In August 2019, Dorsey added:

“We love you, Bitcoin \[...\] we saw 3.5 million customers use Cash Card in June, typically using it to purchase multiple times per week.
