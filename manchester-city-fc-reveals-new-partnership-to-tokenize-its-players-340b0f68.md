English Premiere Leage football club Manchester City (Man City) has announced a partnership with South Korean blockchain football gaming startup Superbloke.

## Fans can support players through blockchain

Under the partnership announced by Man City on Aug. 26, Superbloke incorporates the club’s players into its blockchain-powered soccer game FC Superstars enabling fans to support the athletes through online gaming.

Following the partnership, Superbloke becomes Man City’s official blockchain-based Gacha partner in Korea, Japan and South East Asia, as the club announced.

By using the DApp, Man City’s fans can build and train a digital team by collecting and training Manchester City digital player cards using real-life match stats and in-game training, the press release notes.

At the time, the startup stated that it will also conduct various events and collaborations with Man City through the partnership.

In the press release, Damian Willoughby, senior vice president of partnerships for City Football Group, pointed out the Man City’s growing relationship with gaming in order to open unique experiences for fans to engage with the club through digital platforms.

Earlier in August, English Premier League football club Leicester City FC announced the renewal of its partnership with multi-asset and crypto investment platform eToro.
