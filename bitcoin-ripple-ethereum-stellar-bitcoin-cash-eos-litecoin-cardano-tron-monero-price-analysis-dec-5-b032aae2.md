# Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum, Stellar, Bitcoin Cash, EOS, Litecoin, Cardano, TRON, Monero: Price Analysis, Dec. 5 ...

###### 2018-12-05 17:12

Mike Kayamori, CEO of Quoine, expects Bitcoin to make new lifetime highs by the end of next year, and believes that the bottom is close to current levels.

There is a possibility that the price will remain stuck around current levels for the next few days.

## XRP/USD

The bulls have been trying to keep Ripple above the immediate support of $0.33108 for the past two days but they have not been able to secure a strong rebound.

However, if the bulls push prices above the 20-day EMA, the ADA/USD pair can rally to the overhead resistance of $0.060105.

## TRX/USD

Though TRON has not broken out of the 20-day EMA in the past few days, we like the way it has held its support.

The bulls have been holding the TRX/USD pair above $0.0133 level for the past five days, whereas, the bears have been defending the 20-day EMA on the upside.

If the bulls scale the 20-day EMA, a rally to the next overhead resistance of $0.0183 is probable.
