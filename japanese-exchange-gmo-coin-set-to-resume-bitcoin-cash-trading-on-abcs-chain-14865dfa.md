GMO Coin, a Japanese cryptocurrency exchange, has resumed Bitcoin Cash (BCH) trading with the BCHABC blockchain, Finance Magnates (FM) reports Dec. 3.

Finance Magnates writes that they “reached out to the company to enquire which of the two versions of Bitcoin Cash” the exchange will be listing.

The spokesperson is quoted as answering “in our company, the one shown as BCH indicates a Bitcoin Cash called BCHABC.”

As Cointelegraph recently reported, it has been over a week since the Bitcoin Cash blockchain has split in two.

BCHABC, the apparent winning faction, is the more “conservative” network, as Cointelegraph explained, which stands against bringing any radical changes to the BCH software.

In the end, the “battle” ended when Calvin Ayre, a supporter of the “losing” faction (BCH SV), called for a “permanent split” after declaring that BCH SV “no longer want\[s\] the name Bitcoin Cash.”

The same post also claimed that “Bitcoin SV is the original Bitcoin (BTC) not the original Bitcoin Cash” and accused other blockchains of having “tinkered it \[Bitcoin\] to death.”
