# Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, EOS, Stellar, Litecoin, Bitcoin SV, TRON, Cardano: Price Analysis, Jan. 4 ...

###### 2019-01-04 17:01

The 20-day EMA has turned flat and the RSI has dipped below 50 levels, which shows that the bulls have surrendered their momentum in the short term.

## ETH/USD

The level of $167.32 has been acting as a strong resistance for the past two days.

## BCH/USD

Bitcoin Cash could not break out of the 50-day SMA, which is a negative sign.

The BCH/USD pair will pick up momentum on a break out and close (UTC time frame) above the 50-day SMA.

The flat 20-day SMA and the RSI close to the 50 level suggests a consolidation in the near term.

## TRX/USD

The bulls could not sustain the breakout on Jan. 3, but TRON has not given up ground, which suggests buying at lower levels.

The breakout above the downtrend line can carry the TRX/USD pair to the next level of $0.0246.
