# Ledger: Recently Discovered Wallet Vulnerabilities Not Critical ...

###### 2018-12-28 18:12

Ledger claimed that recently uncovered vulnerabilities in its hardware wallets are not critical in an official Medium blog post on Dec. 28.

Yesterday at the 35C3 Refreshing Memories conference in Berlin, researchers claimed that they were able to hack the Trezor One, Ledger Nano S and Ledger Blue cryptocurrency wallets.

The reason Ledger says that the vulnerability is not critical is that “they did not succeed to extract any seed nor PIN on a stolen device” and “sensitive assets stored on the Secure Element remain secure.”

According to the company, the Ledger Nano S vulnerability “demonstrated that physically modifying the Ledger Nano S and installing malware on the victim’s PC could allow a nearby attacker to sign a transaction after the PIN is entered and the Bitcoin (BTC) app is launched.”

While the researchers claimed that the vulnerability allowed them to “send malicious transactions to the ST31 \[the secure chip\] and even confirm it ourselves” Ledger denies its, stating:

“Their firmware runs snake on the MCU in Bootloader mode.

For this reason, Ledger concluded:

“This attack is definitely interesting, but does not allow to guess someone’s PIN in real conditions (it requires that you never move your device at all).”

Furthermore, because of this vulnerability, Ledger stated that the next Ledger Blue firmware update will feature a randomized keyboard for the pin.
