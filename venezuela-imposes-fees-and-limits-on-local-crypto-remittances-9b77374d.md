According to the document, the National Superintendency of Crypto Assets and Related Activities (SUNACRIP) will now be responsible for taxation related to the sending and receiving of cryptocurrencies.

According to the new requirements, the state has set out monthly limits and commissions, payable to SUNACRIP, on cryptocurrency remittances.

The document also sets the monthly limit for crypto remittances in national state-backed digital currency Petro, at 10 Petro per month.

The document does not explain how the government is going to control services used to transact in decentralized cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin (BTC), except that it will use a “technological platform” to proceed with taxation.

As Cointelegraph reported earlier this month, Bitcoin weekly trading volumes in Venezuela have reached a new all-time high amidst massive hyperinflation and an ongoing presidential crisis.

Moreover, Venezuela and Colombia account for 85 percent of trading volumes on the p2p exchange in Latin America, according to Cointelegraph en Español.

Venezuela introduced a new legal framework for cryptocurrencies and related technologies earlier this month.
