# Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Stellar, EOS, Litecoin, Cardano, Monero, TRON: Price Analysis, Dec. 3 ...

###### 2018-12-03 15:12

Higher demand from large traders has encouraged U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase to start an OTC desk for its selected customers.

Traders can watch the $0.30 level closely and liquidate positions if the bears sustain the price below the support line of the descending channel.

If the XRP/USD pair attracts buyers at one of the above-mentioned support levels, it will move up to $0.40, which will act as a major resistance, as the 20-day EMA is located at this level.

Contrarily, if the bulls succeed in defending the bottom of the range, the ETH/USD pair might extend its consolidation for a few more days.

The traders should wait for a new buy setup to form before initiating a long position in the EOS/USD pair.

## LTC/USD

Litecoin failed to break out of the 20-day EMA in the past few days, which shows that the bears are not waiting for higher prices to sell.

If the bulls bounce off the supports and break out of the 20-day EMA, the virtual currency can rally to the next overhead resistance at $47.246.
