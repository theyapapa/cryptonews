The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Enforcement Division has released its annual enforcement report for the 2018 fiscal year (FY), Friday, Nov. 2.

The report notes actions by the Division against fraudulent Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs).

According to the report, since the formation of the Division’s Cyber Unit at the end of FY 2017, the commission’s focus on cyber-related misconduct, including ICOs, has been growing steadily.

According to the report:

“In the past year, the Division has opened dozens of investigations involving ICOs and digital assets, many of which were ongoing at the close of FY 2018.”

The report notes several illicit ICOs, three of which defrauded investors of over $68 million: the cofounders of a purported financial services startup raised $32 million from thousands of investors, the “blockchain evangelist” president of Titanium Blockchain Infrastructure Services Inc. raised $21 million, while a “recidivist law violator” raised $15 million by promising a 13-fold monthly return on investments.

In October, Yahoo Finance and Decrypt Media released a joint report, claiming that the SEC has expanded its crackdown on ICOs, putting “hundreds” of projects at risk.

The report further states that, in response to SEC pressure, dozens of firms “quietly agreed” to refund investors’ money and pay fines, rather than attempt to reach a legal compliance.
