# Popular Crypto Mining GPU Price Down 67% Since February ...

###### 2018-12-19 19:12

AMD’s popular Radeon RX580 graphics processing unit (GPU), which has been widely used by crypto miners, is now being sold for $179.99, gaming magazine PC Gamer reported on Thursday, Dec. 19.

This means that the GPU, which reached a peak average price around $550 in February 2018, has seen a 67 percent price drop throughout the bearish year, dubbed “Crypto Winter” by some crypto entrepreneurs.

As Cointelegraph previously reported, the year-long bear market has had a significant effect on the crypto mining industry, with dramatic drops in revenue forcing many miners to quit the industry and sell off their equipment.

Consequently, the “Crypto Winter” has also affected GPU producers like Nvidia and AMD.

Reduced interest in crypto mining resulted in a sharp drop-off in GPU sales to miners with AMD reporting that their crypto-related sales in Q3 2018 were “negligible.”

In mid-November, Nvidia’s share price plunged after Q3 financial results revealed a “crypto hangover” in the company’s GPU sales.

In other words, the crypto mining frenzy drove up prices for Nvidia’s GPUs, but once that demand disappeared, prices did not decrease quickly enough to attract customers who were waiting for more affordable cards.
