# FATF Regulations – Is It the End of Crypto Anonymity? ...

###### 2019-08-04 08:08

The lack of regulation in the crypto markets can be fertile ground for money laundering, terrorist financing, tax evasion, etc.

In fact, after the G-20’s determination to comply with the FATF standards, we are soon going to see their implementation around the world, and crypto users will be required to put aside their privacy — and for some, even their ideology — in order to use services under the control of the regulator.

## White vs. black crypto markets

Pretty soon, what we are going to get is two separate groups of crypto addresses: clean crypto and black-market crypto.

This clarification will determine the executable methods for crypto tax calculation, such as determine whether taxpayers need to use a specific identification method to report or if there are other acceptable methods.

While the specific identification method identifies the exact Bitcoin (BTC) that the user sold, and calculates his/her tax liability on the sale of the actual Bitcoin based on the blockchain evidence, the first-in-first-out (FIFO) method is not taking under consideration real-time user activity.

In order to calculate using the specific identification method, one has to identify — using evidence from the blockchain — the purchase dates and sales date of all Bitcoin that came in and out of his/her wallet for the same tax year.

The specific identification method, just like the new FATF regulation, will require the crypto taxpayer to disclose all his/her crypto addresses.
