###### 2019-04-29 06:04

Finland’s Financial Supervisory Authority (FIN-FSA) is set to assume its role as a registration authority and supervisory agency for crypto industry participants as new legislation comes into force this week.

With Finland’s Act on Virtual Currency Service Providers set to come into effect on May 1, the watchdog clarifies that it will henceforth be statutorily required to register all crypto exchanges, custodian crypto wallet providers and cryptocurrency issuers operating in the country.

As FIN-FSA notes, the new Finnish legislation has been drafted on the basis of the European Union (EU)’s Fifth Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Directive.

FIN-FSA outlines that registration will necessitate statutory compliance with multiple rules, including those pertaining to the storage and protection of client funds, segregation of service provider and client assets, rules for the marketing of services and heeding AML/CFT laws.

The briefing will reportedly lay out FIN-FSA’s registration timeline and the steps and schedule for the procedure, as well as addressing formal and draft regulations and guidelines applicable to industry participants.

Notwithstanding the new legislation, FIN-FSA states that investor protection is not fully resolved within the new measures, and reminds the public that:

“The risks related to virtual currency investments remain unchanged.

As reported this March, Helsinki-based international peer-to-peer crypto exchange LocalBitcoins has recently announced its forthcoming supervision by FIN-FSA in accordance with the country’s new legislation.
