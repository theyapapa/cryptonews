# Major US Crypto Exchange Coinbase Adds Cash Withdrawals to PayPal ...

Major American cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has introduced free of charge cash withdrawals to online payment system PayPal, according to an announcement published Dec. 14.

From now on, Coinbaseâ€™s United States-based customers are able to withdraw their cash balances to Paypal.

Coinbase and PayPal previously integrated in 2016, when Coinbase added support for the payment platform in addition to major credit cards.

At the time, Coinbase users were able to sell Bitcoin (BTC) and have their fiat funds deposited to a PayPal wallet.

As Cointelegraph reported in September, Coinbase announced a new process that will purportedly allow it to list more digital assets faster.

Issuers who want to submit tokens at Coinbase via the newly adopted process will have to use a special form, which will subsequently be evaluated by the exchange team against their digital asset framework.

In November, Coinbase launched over-the-counter (OTC) trading for institutional customers.
