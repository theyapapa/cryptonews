# ETH Dev Suggests Moving to ‘ASIC-Friendly Algorithm’ After ProgPoW Decision ...

An Ethereum (ETH) code contributor has suggested that Ethereum developers ‘embrace’ specialized mining hardware (ASICs) in a reply on Ethereum developer forum Ethereum Magicians, Jan. 7.

As Cointelegraph reported last week, Ethereum core developers have tentatively decided to implement a new proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm, dubbed ProgPoW, which would decrease the efficiency divide between ASICs and GPUs, while rendering current Ethereum ASICs obsolete.

According to another developer on Ethereum Magicians, David Vorick, ProgPoW would favor larger ASIC producers because the more complex hardware needed would exacerbate the economies of scale involved.

The developer argued that the amount of money at stake guarantees that at least some hardware producers will choose to keep new ASICs secret to prevent a new hard fork making the tech obsolete.

Vorick then poses the question:

“If a hardware developer manages to create a ProgPoW ASIC that outperforms GPUs by a surprising margin \[...\] is it better for that manufacturer to keep their discovery secret and mine secretly, or is it better for that manufacturer to sell openly?”

Linzhi, a Chinese mining hardware producer, had already released a call to Ethereum developers to “publish rules for what constitutes a good ProgPoW ASIC maker.”

Today we are calling upon the Ethereum developers to publish rules and requirements for what constitutes a good ProgPoW ASIC maker.”
