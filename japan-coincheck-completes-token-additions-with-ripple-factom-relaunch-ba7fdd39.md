###### 2018-11-26 04:11

Hacked Japanese cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck has begun trading a wider range of assets Nov. 26, a press release confirmed, ten months after funds worth over $530 million were stolen.

Monex Group, the Internet broker which purchased the hacked exchange in March for around $33.5 million, made the announcement following months of remedial measures and security improvements.

The release of Ripple (XRP) and Factom (FCT) token trading means Coincheck is now operating services for all “tradable cryptocurrencies” on the platform.

“Coincheck has been steadily resuming as each service’s technical safety is confirmed through the supports of external experts,” the release stated, adding:

“As of the announcement today regarding XRP and FCT, Coincheck has resumed depositing and purchasing services for all tradable cryptocurrencies on Coincheck.”

Various other services, including leveraged transactions and an affiliate service, will go live in due course, Monex added.

Two weeks previously, Coincheck had resumed trading of NEM (XEM), the token which bore the brunt of its losses, while further functionality was restored at the end of October.

Last week, Zaif, another Japanese platform which lost around $60 million in September this year due to a hack, completed its handover to new owner Fisco, officials reporting they planned to begin compensating customers before the end of November.
