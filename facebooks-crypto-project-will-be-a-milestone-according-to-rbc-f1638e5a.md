Global investment bank RBC Capital Markets believes that Facebook’s upcoming crypto project will be a major milestone in the firm’s history, CNBC reports June 14.

In a note to investors, RBC Capital analysts Mark Mahaney and Zachary Schwartzman reportedly said that Facebook’s long-rumored stablecoin project “may prove to be one of the most important initiatives in the history of the company.”

A part of the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), RBC Capital predicted that the social media giant’s cryptocurrency project will “unlock new engagement and revenue streams.”

According to the report, RBC Capital expects the project’s white paper to be released on June 18, joining other sources that expressed similar expectations earlier this month.

To date, RBC Capital has predicted that Facebook will use its crypto initiative to facilitate three spheres of its business: applications and gaming, payments, and commerce.

Meanwhile, RBC Capital also has an outperform rating on Facebook, with a price target of $250 per share.

Earlier today, the Financial Times reported that Facebook hired Standard Chartered Bank’s head of public affairs Ed Bowles for its cryptocurrency project.
