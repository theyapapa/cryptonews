###### 2018-10-23 20:10

Major U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has launched the USD Coin stablecoin (USDC), making it the first stablecoin for trade on the platform, Cointelegraph learned at the Money 20/20 conference Oct. 23.

Coinbase customers in supported jurisdictions can now purchase, sell, send, and receive USDC at coinbase.com and the exchange’s iOS and Android apps.

Coinbase notes in the statement that its U.S.-based customers outside the state of New York are able to buy and sell, while customers around the world can send and receive the coin.

Coinbase states that USDC will be coming to Coinbase Pro in the coming weeks and is already supported on Coinbase Wallet, with more jurisdictions to become available in the future.

At the Money 20/20 conference in Las Vegas, Coinbase President and COO Asiff Hirji said:

“We are issuing stablecoins backed 1:1 with the U.S. dollar, completely audited, completely transparent.

A stablecoin is a digital currency tied to another stable currency like the U.S. dollar, and is designed to minimize price volatility.

Earlier this month, another stablecoin Tether (USDT) found itself at the source of controversy after volatility caused it to lose its long-time peg to the U.S. dollar.
