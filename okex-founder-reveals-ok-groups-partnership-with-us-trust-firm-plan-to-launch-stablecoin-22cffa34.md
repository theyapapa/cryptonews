Star Xu — founder of exchange services provider OKCoin and the world’s 6th largest crypto exchange OKEx — has announced OK Group’s partnership with blockchain-focused trust company Prime Trust, prospectively allowing the firm to launch its own compliant stablecoin.

The news was revealed in a tweet from Star Xu on March 28, retweeting an earlier March 27 tweet from Prime Trust announcing the partnership.

Star Xu has written that the new partnership will see OK Group undertaking “an in-depth collaboration and offer\[ing\] diverse, secure and regulatory compliant services with Prime Trust.”

Prime Trust’s earlier tweet on March 27 had explicitly noted OK Group’s reported plans to launch a compliant stablecoin, stating that:

“Prime Trust and OK Group signed a strategic investment agreement this month.

OK Group is our lead strategic investor and plans to launch a compliant stablecoin #OKUSD, which will operate #OKChain in the future @starokcoin”

According to its Twitter profile, Prime Trust is a blockchain-focused trust company that is a qualified crypto and fiat currency custodian and chartered, regulated financial institution, providing compliance services that include AML/KYC checks, funds processing, as well as asset protection for initial coin offerings.

As per Prime Trust’s tweet, it will run on the OKChain blockchain — OKEx’s blockchain that is currently in its final development stage, as the exchange had announced earlier this week.

OK Group’s prospective entrance into the rapidly growing stablecoin sector will follow the likes of other compliant USD-pegged assets, such as the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS)-approved Gemini Dollar (GUSD) and Paxos Standard Token (PAX).
