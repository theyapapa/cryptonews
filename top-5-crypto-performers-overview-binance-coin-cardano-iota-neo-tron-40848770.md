A breakout of the channel will start a new uptrend that can carry the virtual currency to $15, with a minor resistance at $12.

Contrary to our opinion, if the bulls fail to breakout of the channel, the bears will try to sink the digital currency below $5.

However, the bears could not push the prices back to the bottom of the range: this shows demand for the digital currency close to $7 level.

## TRX/USD

Tron has slowly but surely cemented its place among the top 10 cryptocurrencies.

The company also announced a tie up with ABCC cryptocurrency exchange to list tokens based on Tronâ€™s TRC10 technical standard.

Last week, the bulls again attempted to breakout of the range but found selling at the resistance line of the range at $0.02815521.

If, however, the bears defend the top of the range, a few more weeks of range bound action is likely to continue.
