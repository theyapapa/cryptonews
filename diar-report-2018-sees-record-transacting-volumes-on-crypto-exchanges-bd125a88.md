Cryptocurrency exchanges have closed 2018 with “record transacting volumes,” according to a report by research firm Diar published Jan. 14.

In its report, Diar notes that both the number of trades and the trade volume have increased on major crypto exchanges in 2018, compared to 2017 figures.

According to Diar’s data, the combined trade volume of the USD markets on major United States crypto exchange Coinbase increased by 21% in 2018 versus 2017.

In addition to growing trade volumes, Coinbase reportedly registered a 14.1% increase in the number of trades: from 82.7 million deals in 2017 to 94.4 million in 2018.

At the beginning of 2018, a number of mining pools led by application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) manufacturer Bitmain, together with the ViaBTC pool, which the company has invested in, held control over 53 of Bitcoin network’s hash power.

Diar highlights that the power shift from few major mining pools to a larger number of smaller ones is an important factor in ensuring the network’s security from potential attacks:

“Unknown miners closed December having solved a whopping 22 percent of the total blocks up from 6 percent at the start of last year.

In 2018, Coinbase reportedly saw a 20 percent increase in BTC trade volume during OTC markets hours, while Grayscale’s Bitcoin Investment Trust saw a 35 percent drop in volumes compared to the same period in 2017.
