A Los Angeles man pleaded guilty to running a $25 million Bitcoin (BTC) money laundering scheme and sale of methamphetamine.

## Possible life sentence

News outlet U.S. News reported on Aug. 23 that 25-year-old Kunal Kalra has pleaded guilty to charges including money laundering and distributing methamphetamines.

The authorities allegedly claim that from 2015 through 2017 Kalra exchanged BTC and dollars, ran a Bitcoin ATM and admitted to making deals with drug dealers and other criminals.

## Sold meth to an undercover agent

Kalra also reportedly sold two pounds of meth to an undercover law enforcement agent.

According to the report, he also faces money laundering charges in Texas, which were filed earlier this month.

In July, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that the authority will work to prevent Bitcoin from becoming an “equivalent of Swiss-numbered bank accounts.”

According to Mnuchin, the government combats “bad actors in the U.S. dollar every day to protect the U.S. financial system.”
