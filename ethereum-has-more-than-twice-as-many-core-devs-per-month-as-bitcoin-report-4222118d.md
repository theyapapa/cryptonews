###### 2019-03-09 06:03

Ethereum (ETH) has the most developers working on its base protocol of all cryptocurrencies, not counting community project developers, according to a report by crypto asset management firm Electric Capital.

Per the post, the company fingerprinted over 20,000 code repositories and 16 million commits to obtain data, which reveals that on average 216 developers contribute code to ETH repositories every month.

An even more restrictive data set, which only considers contributions to core protocol, reveals that:

“Ethereum is by far the most active at 99 monthly developers on average.”

Bitcoin, on the other hand, has an average of 47 core protocol developers every month, making it the second most active.

The data also reveals that big platforms such as Eos (EOS), Tron (TRX) and Cardano (ADA) all have over 25 monthly core protocol developers on average.

Another point made in the report is that while the market lost about 80 percent since its peak, data shows that the monthly active developer base has fallen by only 4 percent.

According to the company’s global data, over 4,000 developers per month contribute code to over 2,800 public coins.
