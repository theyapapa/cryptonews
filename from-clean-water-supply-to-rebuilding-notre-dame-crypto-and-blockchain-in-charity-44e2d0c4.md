# From Clean Water Supply to Rebuilding Notre Dame: Crypto and Blockchain in Charity ...

The technology that underpins cryptocurrencies has been gradually entering the charity sector, purportedly providing more transparency and trust to the industry — especially given a decrease in people’s trust in charity organizations, where the public is increasingly concerned about how charities spend raised money.

## Governments and blockchain projects embrace charity space

Governments around the world have been showing increasing interest in blockchain deployment and digital currency adoption for philanthropy, although few of them have implemented clear regulations toward the new type of currency at the legislative level.

Days after, an array of companies, organizations and individuals donated millions of dollars to reconstruct the damaged cathedral, with the international cryptocurrency and blockchain community reacting promptly by launching donation campaigns as well.

Blockchain’s potential to ensure fairer, more equitable aid and distribution of donated funds has been recognized by leading organizations around the world, including the United Nations, the Red Cross and Save the Children, and the Notre Dame case is just a local example of how effectively blockchain has been helping raise charitable donations in recent years.

United Kingdom-based Charities Aid Foundation (CAF) recognizes digital currency and blockchain as the technologies that “have some fascinating features that could have a huge impact on charities and charitable giving,” and points out their “potential for ‘radical transparency’ of donations, and the possibility of making it easier to get aid money to where it is needed.”

Commenting on blockchain integration into internal processes of charity organizations, Rhodri Davies, head of policy and program leader at CAF, told Cointelegraph:

“Radical transparency through the use of decentralised ledgers (either using crypto or some form of tokening) bring the potential for enhancing trust among donors by giving far greater certainty over how money is spent — this would be particularly valuable when giving cross-border into jurisdictions where there are often justifiable fears about corruption and mismanagement.”

## How blockchain and crypto may transform the charity space

Recent years have marked a significant progress in the adoption of digital currencies and blockchain in philanthropy by some governments and international organizations.
