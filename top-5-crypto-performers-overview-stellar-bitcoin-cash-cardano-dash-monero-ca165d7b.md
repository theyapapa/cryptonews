## BCH/USD

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) was the second-best performer for the week, rising about 15 percent.

Though there was apparently no specific news driving prices higher, the digital currency has a history of vertical rallies and waterfall declines.

## ADA/USD

Cardano (ADA) announced this week that it will be one of the founding members of the European Commissionâ€™s International Association for Trusted Blockchain Applications.

Opposite to our expectations, if the digital currency turns down from the current levels, it will extend it stay in the range for a few more weeks.

## XMR/USD

In Monero (XMR) news, the altcoin completed a hard fork on March 09 that will help improve its privacy, security and ASIC resistance.

The bulls are attempting to carry the XMR/USD pair above the resistance of the range at $60.1470 and the 20-week EMA at $62.50.

On the other hand, if the price turns down from the overhead resistance, the virtual currency will remain range bound for a few more weeks.
