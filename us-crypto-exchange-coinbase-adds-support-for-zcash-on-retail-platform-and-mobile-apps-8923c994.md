###### 2018-12-05 19:12

Major American cryptocurrency exchange and wallet provider Coinbase has launched support for Zcash (ZEC) at Coinbase.com and the exchange’s Android and iOS apps, according to a blog post published Dec. 5.

Per today’s announcement, Coinbase customers can now purchase, sell, send, receive, and store ZEC.

Coinbase further notes that additional jurisdictions may be introduced later.

Coinbase therefore outlines in the post:

“Initially, customers can send ZEC to Coinbase from both transparent and shielded addresses, but only send off Coinbase to transparent addresses.

The move follows the introduction of ZEC on the Coinbase Pro platform in late November.

Zcash has not responded to Coinbase’s announcement, showing a slump by almost 10 percent on the day, according to CoinMarketCap.

As Cointelegraph reported last week, Coinbase has launched over-the-counter (OTC) trading for institutional customers, purportedly following an increased demand for OTC crypto trading from institutional players.
