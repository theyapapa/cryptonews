# JPMorgan Warns Stablecoins Like Libra at Risk of ‘System Gridlock’ ...

The new breed of stablecoins led by Facebook’s Libra could be vulnerable to failure in periods of network stress.

According to an analysis from JPMorgan released on Sept. 5, they lack the short-term liquidity of other payments systems, so usage could grow faster than the network can safely support.

## Transaction growth could outpace network capacity

In a note to clients, analysts highlighted the potential for substantial growth in stablecoin payment systems like Libra.

The note explains:

“As currently designed and proposed, they do not take into account the microstructure of operating such a payment system.

The risk of payment system gridlock, particularly during periods of stress, could have serious macroeconomic consequences.”

## Further risk to Libra from negative yields

Another risk pointed out in the note was that of negative yields.

JPMorgan notes:

“Any system that relies on reserve-asset income to fund operational and other ongoing costs becomes unstable in a negative yield world \[...\] a fully negative yielding Libra reserve has become a plausible (some would argue likely) risk.”
