###### 2019-02-22 04:02

The CEO of United States cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase added to theories surrounding the downfall of Canadian platform QuadrigaCX in fresh social media comments on Feb. 21.

In a series of tweets, Brian Armstrong suggested the exchange, which is currently undergoing restructuring procedures and owes creditors around $190 million, did not attempt fraud.

“(QuadrigaCX) was one of the oldest exchanges in existence (founded in 2013).

Users of the now-defunct Quadriga are currently battling through the courts to secure missing funds.

The exact circumstances under which their deposits disappeared remain uncertain; the exchange’s CEO, Gerald Cotten, unexpectedly died in December.

Big Four auditor Ernst & Young is currently in charge of consolidating Quadriga’s wallets and accounts.

On Thursday, the exchange transferred its remaining accessible wallet balances to the company’s possession.
