Galaxy Digital founder and crypto enthusiast Mike Novogratz has predicted that Bitcoin’s (BTC) price will stabilize between $10,000 and $14,000, in an interview with CNBC on June 27.

Referring to Facebook’s entry into crypto with Libra, Novogratz said:

“One of the largest companies in the world said we believe in cryptocurrencies.

Novogratz’s comments follow Bitcoin’s price fall by $1,400 yesterday, June 26.

Novogratz also commented on Facebook’s forthcoming stablecoin Libra, saying that “The Libra association will have a hundred votes, so it will be distributed.

On May 31, Novogratz stated that “on a go-forward basis, Bitcoin probably consolidates somewhere between $7,000 and $10,000,” and added:

“If I’m wrong on that, I think I’m wrong to the upside, that there’s enough excitement and momentum that it could carry through.”

This week, many commentators argued that Bitcoin’s price surge was due to Facebook’s announcement of Libra; however Bitcoin was already trading above $9,000 when Facebook formally unveiled its Libra cryptocurrency protocol.

Craig Erlam, a senior market analyst at the financial trading firm Oanda stated:

“Bitcoin has slowly – by its own standards – been rising in recent months but the launch of Facebook’s Libra has clearly been a catalyst for the recent surge.”
