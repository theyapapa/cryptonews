Chinese crypto mining titan Bitmain’s filing to list an initial public offering (IPO) on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEx) has officially expired, according to an updated list of now-lapsed applications on the HKEx website on March 26.

In a blog post published the same day, the company acknowledged that its IPO application was now inactive, and simultaneously revealed the appointment of a new CEO, Mr. Haichao Wang.

As reported yesterday, Bitmain’s IPO filing — published in English and Chinese on Sept. 26, 2018 — was set to imminently reach the end of a six-month validity window, pursuant to HKEx listing rules.

These rules provide a window for a given application to proceed to a closed-door hearing before the exchange’s Listing Committee, which is tasked with giving the final approval or disapproval of the offering.

At the same time, Bitmain claimed that undergoing the HKEx listing route has “made the company more transparent and standardized,” adding that the “process of rationalization and optimization” has heightened the company’s focus on the core elements of its mission.

The company outlines the range of measures it has taken to streamline and rationalize its operations, revealing the appointment of Mr. Wang as CEO, who is reportedly a veteran of the chip manufacturing industry and has already successfully headed several units within Bitmain.

As previously reported, the extensive earnings disclosures that Bitmain submitted in line with the IPO listing requirements had revealed the firm was shouldering hefty losses amid the bear market.
