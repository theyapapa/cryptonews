# Iran's Crypto Barometer — Regular Users Feeling the Heat ...

The use of cryptocurrency to bypass international sanctions became more evident as reports surfaced that Iran and Russia were looking into the possibility of facilitating bilateral trade with the use of cryptocurrencies.

The countries had begun engaging with each other to explore using cryptocurrency transactions as an alternative to the SWIFT interbank payment system — which Iran has had little or no access to due to the international sanctions.

LocalBitcoins ends trading support in Iran

As Iranians wait for clarity on the promised state-run cryptocurrency, local crypto users have been dealt another blow to their access to trading support.

On May 24, popular cryptocurrency exchange LocalBitcoins announced a ban on users in Iran.

As Bandari explained, the exchange saw booming activity in recent months from its Iranian users:

“Localbitcoins is one of the most popular cryptocurrency trading platforms in Iran.

Despite the exchange imposing a fresh ban on Iranian crypto traders, Bandari was optimistic that other exchanges would come forward to provide continued support:

“At this moment Iranians have access to LocalBitcoins through VPN \[virtual private networks\] which is very common in Iran.

With the support of LocalBitcoins coming to an end, Iranian crypto traders will have to find other cryptocurrency exchanges to service their needs.
