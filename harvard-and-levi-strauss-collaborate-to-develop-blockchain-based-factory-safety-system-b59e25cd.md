Harvard University and American clothing company Levi Strauss & Co announced a collaboration with the New America think tank to develop a blockchain factory safety system, Reuters reported on Jan. 24.

The new system aims to eventually replace external factory health and safety auditors with a self-reporting infrastructure by the workers.

Dr. Eileen McNeely, director of Harvard T.H. Chan’s Sustainability and Health Initiative for NetPositive Enterprise said, “For the last 25 years, work in supply chains has been monitored mainly by audits... A distributed system of inquiry on the blockchain that goes right to the source offers a new solution.”

Three Levi Strauss’ factories located in Mexico employing 5,000 workers will reportedly be the first to use the system this year, another pilot is planned for the next year.

The system will put an annual safety survey on a blockchain.

The survey will reportedly use an index developed by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

Allison Price, executive director of Blockchain Trust Accelerator at New America, said that putting the survey result on a blockchain means that “the results will never be manipulated.”
