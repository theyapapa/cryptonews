United States.-based regulated crypto derivatives and clearing platform LedgerX is giving retail investors the chance to bet on Bitcoin (BTC) hitting $100,000 by 2020.

## New Possibilities for the Retail Crypto Trader

As Bloomberg reported on July 17, the $100,000 call option implies that Bitcoin’s current valuation could increase over ten-fold and hit a $2 trillion market capitalization.

This bullish bet on Bitcoin is the first crypto derivatives product open to mom and pop investors since LedgerX sealed approval from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to serve as a designated contract market for clients of any size, as Cointelegraph reported in June.

## More Bitcoin Investment Options Coming Amid Rising Volume

As reported in June, BitMEX — the world’s single biggest bitcoin derivatives provider — posted record volumes across its operations as Bitcoin (BTC) hit $13,000.

The fund’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) was up almost 300% on the year as of July 9.

The institutional market is also poised for the roll-out of physically-delivered bitcoin futures by institutional cryptocurrency platform Bakkt on July 22.

Anthony Pompliano — the co-founder of Morgan Creek Digital Assets — has recently predicted that Bitcoin will hit $100,000 just a year later than LedgerX’s call option, eyeing 2021.
