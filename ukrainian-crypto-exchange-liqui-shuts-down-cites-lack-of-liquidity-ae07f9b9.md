Following the news the exchange had shut down operations, crypto analyst and host of CNBC's show Cryptotrader, Ran NeuNer, claimed in a tweet that he is expecting more exchanges to close in light of the continuous bear market.

The collapse of crypto markets in 2018 from all-time highs in December 2017 has caused major financial problems at a large number of crypto and blockchain firms.

Earlier this month, the CEO of Switzerland-based cryptocurrency exchange ShapeShift announced the company had laid off a third of its team, citing “the latest bear market cycle.”

Yesterday, Canadian crypto exchange QuadrigaCX announced it had shut down for maintenance.
