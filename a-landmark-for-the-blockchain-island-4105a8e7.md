Malta becoming the “Blockchain Island” is no longer a distant dream but a reality, which — within a very short time frame and through our tireless commitment to incorporate, use and embrace this new, emergent technology — has propelled our country to the forefront of the blockchain sphere; reaffirming our position as a main point of reference for other countries that will inevitably follow.

The latest announcements by the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) and the Malta Digital Innovation Authority (MDIA) were highly significant for investors and operators who are looking at establishing their operations and headquarters in Malta.

It was an important achievement for the Blockchain Island when the MFSA approved the first Virtual Financial Assets (VFA) agents, later followed by the MDIA issuing the first accreditation of System Auditors of Innovative Technology Arrangements.

Both VFA agents and the system auditors have a huge responsibility in their hands, as they will act as the gatekeepers of this emergent industry, which the Malta Government estimates will be as big as the gaming sector in a few years’ time.

VFA agents are mainly responsible for undertaking preliminary due diligence applicants and conducting the Financial Instrument Test, which represents a two-layered set of mandatory tests set out under the Virtual Financial Assets Act that determines the regulatory regime to which a distributed ledger technology (DLT) asset is subject.

The same as the VFA agents duties, the system auditors will assist the MDIA throughout the certification of the clients Innovative Technological Arrangements and Services platforms, meaning that system auditors will be MDIA’s main point of reference.

## Bridging the authorities

Besides having the first VFA agents and system auditors in place, there’s another milestone that cannot go unnoticed, and that is the bridging between both authorities — i.e., the MFSA and the MDIA — who will be issuing a license.
