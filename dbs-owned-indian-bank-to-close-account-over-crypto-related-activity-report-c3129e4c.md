# DBS-owned Indian Bank to Close Account Over Crypto-Related Activity: Report ...

###### 2019-01-15 13:01

India’s first digital bank, Digibank, is allegedly closing accounts involved in cryptocurrency-related activity.

As previously reported, the same Twitter user had just recently posted details of alleged anti-crypto restrictions being imposed on account holders by Kotak Mahindra Bank, India's second largest private sector bank by market cap.

According to Indian CryptoGirl’s tweet, Digibank — which is owned by Singapore-headquartered, major multinational financial services company DBS — imposed a credit freeze on her account after allegedly detecting transactions with entities identified as being virtual currency traders or brokers.

Although I regularly used Kotak Mahindra Bank for my cryptocurrency transactions, I used Digibank only 7 times throughout the year.

According to a screenshot of the email included in the tweet, Digibank further allegedly stated:

“Reserve Bank of India through their public notices have warned/advised \[the\] public regarding risks associated with virtual currencies.

Commenting on the email, and in particular the bank’s alleged claim that “crypto transactions are not allowed” in India, Indian CryptoGirl told Cointelegraph:

“Banks have interpreted RBI's guidelines as per their own convenience \[...\] This however is tantamount to taking the law in your own hands.

Yesterday’s tweet has drawn a range of responses, with some users alleging that not only Digibank and Kotak Mahindra, but also UCO and India Bank have been restricting crypto-related activities.
