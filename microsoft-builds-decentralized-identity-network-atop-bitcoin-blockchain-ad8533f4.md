Microsoft is building a decentralized identity (DID) network atop of the bitcoin blockchain, the tech giant announced on May 13.

In a blog post, the company said the infrastructure, known as the Identity Overlay Network (ION,) is based on an evolving set of open standards developed in conjunction with the Decentralized Identity Foundation.

Microsoft claims its approach addresses throughput issues that mean “the most robust, decentralized, public blockchains operate at just tens of transactions per second, nowhere near the volume a world full of DIDs would demand.”

In explaining the rationale behind ION, the blog post added:

“We believe every person needs a decentralized, digital identity they own and control, backed by self-owned identifiers that enable secure, privacy preserving interactions.

Daniel Buchner, a program manager for the Microsoft Identity team, said the goal of decentralized networks is to remove the control that apps, services and organizations have over digital identifiers such as email addresses and usernames.

Microsoft added that it plans to collaborate with open-source contributors so ION can publicly launch on the bitcoin mainnet in the coming months.

Technology that gives users greater control over their digital identities is gaining traction, with PayPal investing in such a startup last month.
