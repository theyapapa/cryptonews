The new Galaxy S10 series smartphones by South Korean tech giant Samsung will apparently have wallet functions for Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC) and two other tokens.

In its presentation, Samsung revealed various crypto and blockchain related projects featured on the smartphone, including support for Bitcoin, Ethereum, COSMEE token (COSM) and Enjin’s token (ENJ).

Enjin is a cryptocurrency wallet which will reportedly be installed in the new Galaxy S10.

COSMEE claims to have been selected by Samsung as the first partner DApp supported by its upcoming smartphone, while Enji can reportedly be used to send and receive ERC-20 tokens and ERC-1155 crypto game assets.

Varying reports have surfaced regarding blockchain and crypto integration in Samsung’s new phones.

In January, leaked photographs of the new smartphone suggested that the Galaxy S10 would support an Ethereum wallet.

Earlier today, blockchain-centric smartphone Exodus, developed by consumer electronics giant HTC, announced that it has partnered with Opera Browser and added support for multiple DApps.
