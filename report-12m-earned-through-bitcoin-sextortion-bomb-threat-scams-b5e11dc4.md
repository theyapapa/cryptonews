Cybercriminals earned $1.2 million in Bitcoin (BTC) through “sextortion” and bomb threat scams in the last 12 months, cybersecurity company Symantec reports on July 30.

In sextortion scams, the scammers send victims emails that include an old password in the subject line, claiming the device is compromised.

The author of the email further intimates that — if the receiver of the message does not send a requested amount of Bitcoin to the address provided — the embarrassing images will be shared with the victim’s friends, relatives or colleagues.

Syantec also notes similar emails containing bomb threats, claiming that a concealed bomb has been planted in the place where the victim conducts business, which will explode unless Bitcoin is sent by the end of the working day.

According to Symantec, the scams are not targeted and the aforementioned passwords were likely obtained through one of the recent massive data dumps of potentially sensitive information.

Symantec recommended that individuals take extra email security measures to protect against such scams, and advised not to open emails from unknown sources or open links and attachments in scam emails, should they receive one.
