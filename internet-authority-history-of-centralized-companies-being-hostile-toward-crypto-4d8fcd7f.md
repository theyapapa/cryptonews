On June 10, one of the top cryptocurrency media sites, CCN, initially announced that it would shut down, citing a June 3 Google Core Update for stifling its traffic.

At the time of this post on June 10, Borchgrevink and the CCN team were at a loss as to what could have merited such a steep drop off in visibility:

“If Google thinks that CCN, all of a sudden – remember, literally overnight -, is bad, then why not give us the chance to understand the why and give us a way to change before any major update.

Richard Red, research lead at Decred, a community-directed digital currency, said the update presents an issue for both freedom of the press and of information:

“Regardless of how people feel about CCN, the fact that changes to Google's search algorithm can make or break media producers is one of many illustrations of the power wielded by large tech companies running centralized services.

At the time, Google AdWords denied that any change in its regulations would block crypto or initial coin offering (ICO) ads.

However, as previously reported by Cointelegraph, Google’s updated financial products policy clearly stated that an advertisement ban will be imposed on “cryptocurrencies and related content (including but not limited to initial coin offerings, cryptocurrency exchanges, cryptocurrency wallets, and cryptocurrency trading advice).”

Fast-forward to January 2019 and Google’s advertising policy on cryptocurrencies remains relatively unchanged, with smart contract auditing startup Decenter tweeting that the company has blacklisted keywords mentioning Ethereum on Google Ads.

“Any of the keywords that contain ‘ethereum’ in our campaigns are no longer showing ads as of January 9th and are now reporting the following error:”

At the time, the Reddit post’s top comment accused Google of a lack of neutrality:

“Google has various political and economic agendas, and they are quite willing to use their various services to promote their preferences.
