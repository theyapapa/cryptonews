# Top 5 Crypto Performers Overview: BSV, XEM, TRX, BNB, BTC ...

###### 2018-12-09 03:12

Though the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies has plunged about 87 percent from its highs, Bitcoin has managed to maintain its dominance above the 50 mark throughout the fall.

## BSV/USD

Bitcoin SV, born out of the Bitcoin Cash hard fork, is the only one among the top virtual currencies that has been in the green in the past seven days.

While most other top digital currencies are making new year-to-date lows, the XEM/USD pair has not declined much in the past few days.

If the price climbs back into the range and sustains it for three days, it will confirm that the markets have rejected the lower levels.

## TRX/USD

TRON CEO Justin Sun announced that Tron has joined Blockfolio Signal beta, which is a popular mobile cryptocurrency portfolio tracking and management network.

We expect the TRX/USD pair to remain range bound for a few days before making the next decisive move.

## BTC/USD

Though Bitcoin is the fifth best performer in the past seven days, it has continued to make new year-to-date lows.
