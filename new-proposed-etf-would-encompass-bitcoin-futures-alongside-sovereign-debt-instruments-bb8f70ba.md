Reality Shares ETF Trust — a unit of crypto-focused fintech firm Blockforce Capital — has filed a proposal for an exchange-traded-fund (ETF) that would invest in a portfolio which includes both sovereign debt instruments and Bitcoin (BTC) futures.The ETF filing was submitted to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Feb 11.

In regard to BTC futures, the fund would initially — if successful — invest via a wholly owned Cayman Islands-registered subsidiary in the cash-settled BTC futures that are currently traded on CBOE Futures Exchange (CFE) and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).

It also proposes that the fund may evolve to invest in BTC futures that are traded on other exchanges in the future, but emphasizes that the fund “will not invest directly in \[B\]itcoin.”

The filing adds:

“The Fund may gain most of its exposure to Bitcoin Futures through its investment in the Subsidiary, which invests in Bitcoin Futures.

To the extent the Fund invests in such instruments directly, it will seek to restrict its income from such instruments to a maximum of 10 percent of its gross income \[...\] to comply with certain qualifying income tests necessary for the Fund to qualify as a regulated investment company.”

In addition to Bitcoin futures, the proposed fund will also allocate larger investments to more traditional “high-quality, short-term sovereign debt instruments listed for trading on U.S. exchanges and denominated in U.S. dollar, euro, British pounds sterling, Japanese yen and Swiss francs.”

As previously reported, a separate Bitcoin-related ETF by investment firm VanEck and financial services company SolidX — for listing on CBOE’s BZX Equity Exchange — is currently making a circuitous route through various filings with the SEC.
