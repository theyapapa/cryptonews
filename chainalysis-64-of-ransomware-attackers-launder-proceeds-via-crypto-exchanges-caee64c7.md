United States-based blockchain intelligence firm Chainalysis claims that 64% of ransomware attack cash-out strategies involve the laundering of funds via cryptocurrency exchanges.

A ransomware attack involves the infection of a target with malware and the demand of a ransom payment — frequently denominated in cryptocurrencies.

Chainalysis — which provides blockchain analytics tools that enable firms, governments and law enforcement to monitor blockchain transactions and track suspected illicit activities — claims that 64% of ransomware attackers launder their ill-gotten funds via crypto exchanges.

Chainalysis has ostensibly identified 38 exchanges — without disclosing their names — that directly received funds from an address associated with a ransomware attack.

Among other ransomware cash-out strategies analyzed, 12% involved mixing services and 6% involved peer-to-peer networks, while others went via merchant services providers or dark web marketplaces.

The analysis also noted that ransomware attacks typically involve less complex cash-out networks as compared with crypto exchange hacks.

As recently reported, Coveware’s Q1 2019 Global Ransomware Marketplace report revealed that bitcoin (BTC) continues to account for the lion’s share — 98% — of crypto-denominated ransomware payments.
