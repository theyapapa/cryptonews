The official Twitter account of Google's G Suite was reportedly compromised to promote a Bitcoin (BTC) giveaway scam, technology and business news outlet the Next Web reported Nov. 13.

The G Suite Twitter account was reportedly hacked to advertise a BTC giveaway scam to the page’s more than 800,000 followers.

Scammers supposedly spread a message luring users to participate in a fraudulent 10,000 BTC giveaway, concurrently announcing that Google’s G Suite now accepts cryptocurrency as a means of payment.

As previously reported, Google introduced a ban on cryptocurrency advertisements on Jun. 1 to purportedly protect its customers from fraudulent offerings.

Per the new policy, only registered cryptocurrency exchanges could advertise on the Google Adwords platform, targeting U.S. and Japanese audiences.

In October, Google implemented new restrictions on Chrome Web Store extensions, which will likely affect cryptojackers.

Google’s Oct. 1 post reads:

“Today over 70% of malicious and policy violating extensions that we block from Chrome Web Store contain obfuscated code.”
