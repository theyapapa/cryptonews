San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex is going to remove 23 trading pairs ostensibly due to low volume.

In a tweet published on Aug. 15, Poloniex announced that it will be removing 23 trading pairs on August 16, 2019, due to low volume.

The list of pairs slated for removal reads: LTC/XMR, DASH/XMR, ZEC/XMR, MAID/XMR, NXT/XMR, BCN/XMR, LSK/ETH, GNT/ETH, MANA/ETH, QTUM/ETH, STEEM/ETH, OMG/ETH, LOOM/ETH, SNT/ETH, CVC/ETH, KNC/ETH, GAS/ETH, BNT/ETH, LOOM/USDT, SNT/USDT, KNC/USDT, BNT/USDT and FOAM/USDC.

Earlier this year, Poloniex announced that starting from May 29 it will stop offering trading of Ardor (ARDR), Bytecoin (BCN), Decred (DCR), GameCredits (GAME), Gas (GAS), Lisk (LSK), Nxt (NXT), Omni Layer (OMNI) and Augur (REP) for its customers in the United States.

At the time Poloniex said that the decision was motivated by the uncertain regulatory environment in the country.

Conversely, Coinbase Pro tweeted on Aug. 5 that its XTZ/USD and XTZ/BTC trading pairs will soon enter transfer-only mode, accepting inbound transfers of XTZ in supported regions.

However, the company noted that orders cannot be placed or filled at press time, adding that order books will be in transfer-only mode for a minimum of 12 hours.
