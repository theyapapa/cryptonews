BlockFi crypto wealth management and lending company now has over $53 million in client crypto assets under management.

Specifically, the company says that the minimum deposit to earn interest has been lowered.

Bitcoin (BTC) balances of 0.5 BTC and more will begin earning interest on their deposits, while ethereum (ETH) deposits up to 250 ETH will earn 6.2% annual percentage yield (APY).

In March, the company lowered the interest rates for its biggest cryptocurrency deposit accounts.

The company said then that balances of up to or including 25 BTC or 500 ETH would still earn the 6.2% APY, while all balances over that limit were set to earn a 2% rate starting on April 1.

BlockFi has said that it will add a fiat withdrawal fee of 0.0025 BTC and 0.0015 ETH in April, although all withdrawals submitted prior to that will reportedly remain free.

Rather than just “hodling” and hoping that Bitcoin appreciates, investors can purportedly earn a fiat-based yield on their BTC by employing what is referred to as a call overwrite technique, wherein an investor deposits BTC into LedgerX, then sells a call option at a slightly longer date, with a higher strike call option.
