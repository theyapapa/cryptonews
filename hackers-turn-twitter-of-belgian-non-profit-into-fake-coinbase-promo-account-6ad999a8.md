The impersonating account posted what what appeared to be a scam giveaway promotion, allegedly celebrating Coinbase's user base growth in a tweet today, Jan. 9, that has since been deleted.

After taking control of the FEB’s Twitter account, the scammers transformed the account to appear to be affiliated with Coinbase.

By press time, Coinbase branding has been removed from the Twitter account, though retweets from Coinbase’s official account still remain in the account’s feed.

The scam giveaway tweet posted today mimics a common crypto scam model on Twitter, urging followers to send a small amount of crypto in order to receive a larger amount.

The scammers’ tweet urged users to participate in a fraudulent 3,000 BTC giveaway, allegedly in honor of Coinbase’s user base growth to “over 30,000.000 \[sic\] users.”

In addition to the Twitter account’s handle, other signs that the giveaway tweet and accounts were a scam included inconsistent number formatting and grammatical errors.

Crypto-related giveaway scams on Twitter often involve scammers impersonating major industry names, such as Charlie Lee or Elon Musk, subtly changing characters in the original account’s name to dupe users.
