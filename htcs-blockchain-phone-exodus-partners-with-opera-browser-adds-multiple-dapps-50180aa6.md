Blockchain-centric smartphone Exodus, developed by consumer electronics giant HTC, announced that it had partnered with Opera Browser as well as added support for multiple DApps.

The company announced support for Etheremon and Decentraland DApps in its ZIONVault integrated cold storage.

Moreover, according to a Verge report, the smartphone now also supports a Taiwanese DApp called Numbers.

The phone’s previous blockchain-related compatibility included support for a crypto wallet and for the CryptoKitties DApp.

Exodus’ addition of the Opera browser, on the other hand, lets users access the browser’s integrated crypto wallet to make payments and micropayments on the websites that support it.

The Verge reports that Exodus currently only supports payments in Ethereum (ETH), but has plans to add Bitcoin (BTC) and Litecoin (LTC) in the near future.

The Verge also reports that starting in March, Exodus will be available for purchase with fiat currencies, whereas previously the firm only accepted crypto.
