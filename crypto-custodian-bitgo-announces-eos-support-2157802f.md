Cryptocurrency trust and security company BitGo announced the launch of a multi-signature wallet and custody service for EOS.

According to the press release published on Aug. 22, BitGo officially added EOS to the list of its supported assets.

The firm’s chief technology officer Ben Chan commented on the development by pointing out some advantages and challenges presented by the new asset:

“The EOSIO software has some innovative differentiators like its high transaction capacity and fee model that required our engineering team to scale our platform.

We were able to successfully create an experience for EOS users that is seamless and consistent with how we support other coins and tokens.”

## Over 200 cryptos supported

BitGo also added that its security, custody, and liquidity services are protected by multi-signatures, and all of the supported assets are integrated via a single application programming interface.

It is noted that now the service supports over 200 coins and tokens.

As Cointelegraph recently reported, BitGo appointed the wallet provider Xapo’s former senior vice-president Pete Najarian its new chief revenue officer.
