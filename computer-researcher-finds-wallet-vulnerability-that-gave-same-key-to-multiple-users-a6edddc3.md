# Computer Researcher Finds Wallet Vulnerability That Gave Same Key to Multiple Users ...

Online cryptocurrency paper wallet creator WalletGenerator.net previously ran on code that caused private key/public key pairs to be issued to multiple users.

After researching the live code, Denley concluded that the keys were deterministically generated on the live version of the website, not randomly.

In one of MyCrypto’s tests between May 18–23, they attempted to use the website’s bulk generator to make 1,000 keys.

The GitHub version returned 1,000 unique keys, but the live code returned 120 keys.

Running the bulk generator always reportedly returned 120 unique keys instead of 1,000 even when other factors were tweaked, including browser refreshes, VPN changes, or user changes.

As the post puts it:

“ELI5: When generating a key, you take a super-random number, turn it into the private key, and turn that into the public key / address.

However, if the ‘super-random' number is always ‘5,’ the private key that is generated will always be the same.
