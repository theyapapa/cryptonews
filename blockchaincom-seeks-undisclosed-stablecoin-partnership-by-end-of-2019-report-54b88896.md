###### 2019-01-21 15:01

Crypto wallet provider Blockchain.com is seeking to partner with an unnamed stablecoin project by the end of 2019, the firm’s CEO Peter Smith revealed in an interview with crypto news agency The Block Jan. 21.

Blockchain.com, which reportedly provides 32 million wallets, with most of them active to date, is allegedly considering listing a stablecoin on its platform.

In the interview, the CEO of Blockchain.com stressed that the existing high competition in stablecoins will eventually make the market even more active than it is now.

Smith reportedly stated that the firm “will make a move in there soon,” claiming that Blockchain.com is “not here to just make it easy to invest in Bitcoin (BTC).”

Smith explained his positive stance on stablecoins, suggesting that the biggest cryptocurrencies have become more of an investment vehicle rather than tool for making transactions.

While Smith has not specified any exact details about the planned partnership, he noted that Blockchain.com previously invested in a number of still undisclosed stablecoin projects.

In November 2018, Blockchain.com fully launched support for the Stellar (XLM) altcoin on its platform, claiming that the company decided to chose the cryptocurrency due to its scalability capacity, as well as for its capability to create custom tokens.
