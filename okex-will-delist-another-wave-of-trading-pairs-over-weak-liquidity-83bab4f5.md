# OKEx Will Delist Another Wave of Trading Pairs Over ‘Weak Liquidity’ ...

###### 2018-11-27 11:11

Major Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency exchange OKEx announced it was delisting a second swathe of trading pairs due to “weak liquidity” in a blog post Nov. 27.

OKEx, which announced its intention to begin delisting certain pairs and tokens in October and removed the first batch Oct. 31, will now remove a further 49 trading pairs from its order book.

This, the announcement says, is in order to “create a robust trading environment and offer the best trading experience” for traders.

Some assets will lose certain trading pairs, while withdrawals of 26 tokens are set to disappear altogether starting at 5 a.m. CET Nov. 30.

In comments explaining the impetus behind the policy, OKEx said it was acting in order to “protect the interests of its users,” adding:

“We will strictly monitor all listed projects and implement the delisting / hiding mechanism for substandard projects when necessary.”

Regularly topping volume charts, OKEx is currently the second-largest exchange in the world by volume, with only Binance handling more value per day.

At the same time, officials have opted to add a string of new tokens in the form of stablecoins, four of which debuted simultaneously last month.
