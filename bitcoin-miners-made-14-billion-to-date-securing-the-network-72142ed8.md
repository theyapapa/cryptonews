# Bitcoin Miners Made $14 Billion to Date Securing the Network ...

All-time revenue for Bitcoin (BTC) miners has topped $14 billion, according to fresh data from Coin Metrics.

Finance reported on Aug. 30, despite the massive increase in the network’s hash rate — a factor that depresses the profitability of mining — there’s still more money in the game for miners than ever before.

## Bitcoin miner revenue growing exponentially

The report notes that as of the Bitcoin network’s inception, it took eight years for miners’ total revenue to break past the $5 billion mark; the next $5 billion were exponentially faster, taking only a further eight months for revenue to break $10 billion.

## Solid revenue despite soaring hashrate

The $14 billion figure is all the more impressive given that the network’s hash rate has been on a tear for several months now: continuing to break previous records throughout summer — with a new all-time-high posted just today, at 83.5 TH/s by press time.

A higher hash rate indicates that miners are expending record levels of computational processing power to solve and validate blocks — and pocket their rewards.

Looking ahead, Bitcoin is under a year away from its next halving — a pre-coded 50% reduction of block rewards for miners — which is slated for May 2020.

While the halving can have bullish implications for a cryptocurrency’s price (by increasing scarcity), its impact on miners is keenly watched, with some concerned that lower block rewards will deter network participants and thus adversely impact the network's hashing power.
