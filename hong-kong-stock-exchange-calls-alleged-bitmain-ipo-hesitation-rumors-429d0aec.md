###### 2018-12-18 00:12

A Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX) spokesperson has called Bitmain’s alleged hesitation around a purported initial public offering (IPO) “rumors,” in an email to Cointelegraph Dec. 17.

When asked for verification and details on the crypto mining firm’s IPO status, the spokesperson responded that “HKEX does not comment on rumors.”

Blockchain and crypto media had previously reported that the exchange was “hesitant” to host its IPO because of market conditions surrounding the overall crypto mining business.

As Cointelegraph reported in September, Singapore-based firm Temasek was alleged to have committed $560 million dollars to Bitmain’s IPO.

Temasek said in an official statement:

“We've seen commentary about an IPO involving a cryptocurrency company, Bitmain.

In August, Henry Yu, a Hong Kong lawyer and legal expert, told Cointelegraph that a Bitmain investor deck in Chinese used vague and misleading wording when listing investors ahead of its rumored IPO.

In the Bitmain pre-IPO investor deck acquired by Cointelegraph, DST Global is listed as an investor, with claims that the investment was “recently completed.”
