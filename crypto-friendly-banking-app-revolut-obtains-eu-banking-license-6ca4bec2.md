In the coming months, Revolut’s users in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Poland are expected to get a “true current account and a non-prepaid debit card.”

Additionally, users’ deposits will also be covered up to €100,000 (about $113,500) under the European Deposit Insurance Scheme.

According to a post on the company’s support blog, Revolut currently lets its users “gain exposure to” Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Ripple (XRP).

According to data contained in the article, Revolut’s user base generates $4 billion in transaction volume per month, and that there are 8,000 to 10,000 new accounts opened per day.
