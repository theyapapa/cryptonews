Ledger Vault, the custody arm of hardware wallet manufacturer Ledger, will provide its services to Canadian cryptocurrency broker Voyager Digital, according to a press release shared with Cointelegraph on May 21.

Per the release, Voyager Digital will integrate Ledger Vault’s multi-authorization cryptocurrency wallet management system into its trading platform with the aim to increase its overall cybersecurity.

Voyager CEO Steve Ehrlich said that Ledger Value ensures “security of our customer assets on the Voyager platform without compromising the speed and liquidity they’ve come to expect from Voyager.

As Cointelegraph previously reported, Voyager Digital acquired crypto wallet startup Ethos in February.

According to the announcement, the Ethos Universal Wallet software, first released in July 2018, will be integrated into Voyager’s retail and institutional businesses enabling self-custody integrated with a brokerage solution.

The announcement also specifies that this wallet solution is powered by Ledger’s cryptocurrency custody solution.

Demetrios Skalkotos, global head of Ledger Vault stated:

“Ledger Vault is fluid, providing Voyager cold level security with the ability to become hot in a matter of seconds all through one secure interface.”
