San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange Kraken’s users are experiencing difficulties with connecting to the site and application programming interface (API).

In a tweet published on Aug. 13, Kraken warned the public that it is receiving reports of clients having issues connecting to the site and API.

The exchange further states that it is investigating the issue and will post related update.

Back in January, the Exchange Security Report from independent analysts at ICORating gave 16 percent of the world’s biggest crypto trading platforms an A rating, and none of them an A+.

The analysis ranked Kraken (A) as one of the top three most secure exchanges globally.

Earlier in August, Major South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Coinone partnered with cybersecurity audit company CertiK and disclosures company Xangle to provide more safety and transparency for their crypto investors.

In June, Cointelegraph reported that Odyssey, the mainnet for the blockchain-based platform TRON, will be upgraded to version 3.6.
