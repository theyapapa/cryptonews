Bitcoin (BTC) now has more computing power behind its security than ever before, passing another milestone as hash rate reaches an all-time high.

Data from monitoring resource Blockchain confirmed that the Bitcoin network’s total hash rate reached a peak of 79 tera hashes per second (TH/s) on July 20.

Broadly accepted as a measure of how robust Bitcoin’s transaction security has become, hash rate has broken multiple records in recent weeks and months.

In other words, the Bitcoin network now has almost eight times the computing power it had when the price of bitcoin was around $20,000 in late 2017.

The record nonetheless came despite a pause in the gains for the Bitcoin price, which fell off recent highs of $13,800 two weeks ago.

The block reward halving will see the amount of ‘new’ Bitcoin miners can claim per block of verified transactions decrease from 12.5 BTC to 6.25 BTC.

Bitcoin’s mining difficulty, which has also hit new highs recently, will likely see further increases of its own as hash rate continues to expand.
