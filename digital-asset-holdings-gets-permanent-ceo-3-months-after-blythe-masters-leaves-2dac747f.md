United States distributed ledger technology (DLT) provider Digital Asset Holdings has appointed a new permanent CEO after Blythe Masters quit the post last year, the company confirmed in a press release on March 19.

Digital Asset, which Masters began running in 2015, specializes in building DLT-based solutions for various financial entities.

Founded in 2014, the company remained with a temporary CEO — chairman of the firm’s board, AG Gangadhar — for three months after Masters confirmed her departure in December.

Now, the slot will be filled by Yuval Rooz, Digital Asset’s co-founder, who previously worked as the company’s chief operating officer and chief financial officer.

Rooz added:

“It is an honor to be appointed CEO at this exciting and pivotal time for the industry and our company.”

Digital Asset gained considerable prestige from Masters’ involvement, the Wall Street veteran advocating for blockchain technology in the finance industry.

In a further reshuffle, in February, Digital Asset’s Europe head, Gavin Wells, told finance industry news outlet Risk that he would be leaving.
