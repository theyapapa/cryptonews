Eric Swalwell, a United States Democratic presidential candidate for the 2020 elections, has launched a crypto donations campaign, according to a press release shared with Cointelegraph on May 23.

Swalwell, 38, announced his presidential bid on April 8.

A fourth-term Member of Congress from California's Bay Area, he serves on the House Intelligence and Judiciary committees and co-chairs the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee.

Swalwell is also reportedly founder and chairman emeritus of Future Forum, a Congressional caucus of House Democrats that focuses on issues and opportunities for millennial Americans.

As Swalwell launches his crypto donations campaign, he cites a 2019 eToro survey that indicated that 43% of millennial online traders reported less faith in the traditional stock market than in the emerging crypto asset class.

Swalwell’s crypto donations campaign is reportedly enabled by blockchain technology provider The White Company, founded by the entrepreneur Elizabeth White.

As reported, fellow Democratic 2020 presidential candidate Andrew Yang — whose campaign has accepted cryptocurrency donations as of July 2018 — has published a national framework for digital assets regulation as part of his campaign.
