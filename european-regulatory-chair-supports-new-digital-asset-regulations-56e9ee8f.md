The chairman of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) — the European Union-level financial markets supervisor — has said that he supports further regulations on digital assets, political news outlet Roll Call reported on Feb. 27.

Delivering his speech at the FinTech Conference 2019 earlier this week in Brussels, Belgium, ESMA Chairman Steven Maijoor reportedly outlined the need to apply regulations to digital assets in order to help investors.

Maijoor reportedly explained his stance, saying that “without new rules, digital assets will likely fall outside of the regulation of Europe’s securities laws.”

Maijoor continued:

“Where crypto assets do not qualify as financial instruments, we are concerned that the absence of applicable financial rules leaves consumers exposed to substantial risks.

In addition to digital assets, Maijoor proposed to extend new regulations to initial coin offerings (ICOs).

Maijoor reportedly stated that most European jurisdictions support the idea that cryptocurrencies need proper regulation if they received profit or dividend rights, which makes them similar to traditional financial assets.

Per the changes, jurisdictions should ensure that virtual asset service providers — exchanges, wallet providers, and providers of financial services for ICOs — are subject to AML and counter-terrorism financing (CFT) regulations.
