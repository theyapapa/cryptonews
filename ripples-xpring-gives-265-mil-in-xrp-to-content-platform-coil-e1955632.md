Ripple’s infrastructure development and XRP adoption initiative Xpring announced a 1 billion XRP (roughly $265 million) grant to web monetization platform Coil on Aug. 15.

Coil will reportedly use the funds to build an ecosystem of creators, developers, companies and nonprofits that use XRP through the Web Monetization open standard.

## Giving creators control over distribution and monetization

Coil is a platform that provides an alternative method for creators to monetize their content on the internet.

Coil CEO Stefan Thomas commented:

"Creators want more choice and control over how their content is monetized and distributed \[...\] Web Monetization provides a solution that is more fair, open and inclusive for creators and fans around the globe.”

## Neck bone connected to the head bone

As subscribing fans enjoy content, Coil uses an open API called Web Monetization to stream micropayments to creators in real time.

Web Monetization is built on the Interledger Protocol, co-created by Coil CEO Stefan Thomas.

Ethan Beard, Senior Vice President of Xpring, said:

"Advertising and site-by-site subscription models are ready for disruption \[...\] The low cost and fast transactions of XRP makes it an ideal tool for Coil to offer an alternative monetization method and have a positive impact on creators.”
