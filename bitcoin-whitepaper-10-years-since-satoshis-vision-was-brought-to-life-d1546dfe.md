# Bitcoin Whitepaper – 10 Years Since Satoshi’s Vision Was Brought to Life ...

With that being said, the Bitcoin protocol could not have been developed without the foundations laid by previous electronic systems that pioneered decentralized, peer to peer networks using cryptography.

## Influences of Bitcoin’s protocol

Wei Dai’s b-money, Dr. Adam Back’s Hashcash, and Dr. Ralph Merkle’s work on cryptographic hashing have long been credited for having vital influences on the Bitcoin protocol.

Satoshi made use of the data structure from Haber and Stornetta’s original work so that Bitcoin’s timestamp server takes the hash of a block of transactions and timestamps it before it is broadcast to the network.

In the Bitcoin whitepaper, Satoshi directly refers to Back’s Hashcash system as a reference to the Bitcoin proof-of-work algorithm.

## Merkle trees

Another vital part of Bitcoin’s protocol was directly influenced by the work of Dr. Ralph Merkle, who is credited with co-inventing public key cryptography.

## Satoshi’s genius - amalgamating crucial components

With so many critical influences playing different roles in the creation of the Bitcoin whitepaper, it is difficult to identify the most crucial component of the protocol.

Much like others’ assertion, Gün Sirer believes that Satoshi’s ability to coalesce these different influences into a properly working electronic cash system is what sets the Bitcoin whitepaper apart from previous projects:
