Researchers from the Stanford University and Visa Research have developed a privacy mechanism for Ethereum (ETH) smart contracts.

According to the paper, the researchers created “a fully-decentralized, confidential payment mechanism” called “Zether” that is consistent with both Ethereum and other smart contract platforms.

The type of anonymity guaranteed by Zether is more similar to Monero (XMR), the report says, explaining:

“We describe an extension to Zether that can also hide the sender and receiver involved in a transaction among a group of users chosen by the sender.

Though the overhead associated with anonymity scales linearly with the size of the group, no trusted set-up is needed and no changes to the underlying smart contract platform are required.”

“The Zether contract will never transfer funds without first checking an appropriate burn or transfer proof, even if the request comes from another smart contract whose rules do not permit illegal transfers.

This design decision ensures that the security of Zether only depends on itself and not on any outside smart contract.

Even a maliciously written or insecure smart contract cannot cause Zether to misbehave,” the report specifies.
