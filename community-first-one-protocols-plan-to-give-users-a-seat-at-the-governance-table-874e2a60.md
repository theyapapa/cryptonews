# Community First: One Protocol’s Plan to Give Users a Seat at the Governance Table ...

The Hong Kong-headquartered company, which was founded in 2016, says the native blockchain powering its Crypto.com Pay service delivers “instant, seamless, secure and cost-efficient” transactions for merchants and crypto consumers alike — reducing processing fees and waiting times for businesses that have been reluctant to accept virtual currencies as a payment method so far.

After taking notes on other projects, both on-chain and off-chain, Crypto.com has listed three priorities for its governance mechanism going forward: First, it must be easy to understand and to adopt; second, inclusive and open to community participation; and lastly, a system that encourages users to contribute, the team says.

## Continued development

In a recent developer update for the Crypto.com Chain, the platform’s team revealed that the code driving its platform has gone open-source.

At the end of May, the team announced that its Crypto.com Chain had received one of three Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) commercial licenses in Asia that will enable it to be “secure, privacy protected and highly performant,” the company emphasizes.

## New offerings

The ongoing work to strengthen governance and the blockchain’s development comes after Crypto.com unveiled two products designed to help users enjoy “greater financial empowerment.”

Discussing the trio of Crypto.com products, Marszalek added: “MCO Visa Card, Crypto Earn, and Crypto Credit together form a powerful product suite that nobody else in the industry has today.

The platform also recently performed a demo of Crypto.com Pay, which enables crypto payments to be made instantly through existing merchant systems.
