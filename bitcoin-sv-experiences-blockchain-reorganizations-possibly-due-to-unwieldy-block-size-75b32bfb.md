The Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) blockchain is struggling with its large block size following a series of block re-organizations, cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX tweeted on April 19.

In the post, BitMEX reveals that on April 18 its BSV node “experienced 2 block re-organizations.

Blockchain re-organization is a situation when two miners discover a block simultaneously in a blockchain which causes a temporary forking in the network, with the situation resolved when a miner finds the next block as their chain has the more work out of two forks.

In the comments to the tweet, BitMEX explains that it detected two valid competing chains, with a split occurred at block 578,639.

BitMEX’s node reportedly followed the chain on the left until block 578,642, which further leapt to the right.

When asked what it could possibly mean, BitMEX outlined several variants, saying that the Bitcoin Cash SV network is not reliable for payments, the block size limit is too large and network latency is too high.

Major crypto exchange Binance stated that as of April 22, it will delist and cease trading on all trading pairs for BSV.
