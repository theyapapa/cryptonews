# Bitmain Announces Launch Date for Antminer S17 Series ...

Chinese crypto mining giant and ASIC hardware producer Bitmain has announced a launch date of April 9th for its new energy-efficient Antminer S17 series miners.

As previously reported, the new miners will be fitted with Bitmain’s 7nm (nanometer) ASIC mining chip — dubbed “BM1397” — designed for mining cryptocurrencies that use the SHA256 algorithm for their proof-of-work (PoW) — most notably Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH).

Yanxhin — Bitmain’s product manager for the new Antminer S17 series — is quoted in the blog post as saying that the new miners offer a “a steep improvement in the hashrate in terms of space and power consumption,” claiming that BM1397 chips provide “a 28.6 percent improvement in power efficiency in comparison with Bitmain’s previous 7nm chip, the BM1391.”

Alongside electricity consumption cost savings due to increased energy efficiency, Yanxhin proposed that having a “higher hashrate in a single miner \[...\] increases the hashrate density per unit space and saves deployment costs for mining farms.”

Yanxhin also gave their technical perspective on prospective future developments of higher hashrate miners beyond 7nm chips, noting that:

“There is no end to the development of technology.

Having weathered a trying six months as bearish crypto markets triggered company redundancies and a failed public flotation, an unnamed source at Bitmain had allegedly just this week hinted that the forthcoming 2020 Bitcoin block reward halving could offer a positive boost for the launch of the firm’s Antminer S17 series.

Bitmain had notably launched its Antminer S9 model in May 2016, just ahead of Bitcoin’s last halving in July of that year.
