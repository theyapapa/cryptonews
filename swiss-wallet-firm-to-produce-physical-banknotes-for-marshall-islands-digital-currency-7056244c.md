Tangem, a Switzerland-based ‘smart card’ wallet manufacturer will reportedly issue physical banknotes for the Sovereign (SOV), the state digital currency of the Marshall Islands, according to an announcement on Jan. 28.

Per the announcement, physical representations of the digital currency will purportedly ensure that citizens have “fair and equal access to their digital currency, whether or not they have internet connection.”

The firm states that a physical SOV will be a “controllable mechanism” for issuing the currency by the Marshallese government.

Minister David Paul, Minister-in-Assistance to the President of the Marshall Islands, stated, "Tangem will help us ensure all citizens, including those living on more remote outer islands, are able to easily and practically transact using SOV."

The firm issued physical representations of digital currency in May 2018, when it produced 10,000 physical Bitcoin (BTC) banknotes of various denominations in a pilot program.

Marshallese President Hilda Heine’s support for the Sovereign led to a vote of no confidence in the country’s parliament, the Nitijela.

While the parliament had initially backed the creation of a national digital currency, critics of the president declared that the proposed plan for a state-backed digital currency could harm the country’s reputation.
