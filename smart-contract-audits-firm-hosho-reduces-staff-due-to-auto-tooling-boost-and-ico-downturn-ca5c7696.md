# Smart Contract Audits Firm Hosho Reduces Staff Due to Auto Tooling Boost and ICO Downturn ...

Smart contracts auditing firm Hosho has laid off a significant number of staff, citing an increased amount of automated tooling, the firm’s co-founder and president Hartej Sawhney told Cointelegraph on Feb. 1.

While stating that the company did lay off a sufficient part of the team — the exact amount unspecified — Sawhney still noted that Hosho continues to be one of the leading firms in the industry of smart contract auditing and security, specifically in penetration testing.

The Hosho president explained that the staff reduction was caused by a complex set of circumstances, including the downturn in the amount of initial coin offerings (ICO), which is in part due to the major 2018 crypto bear market.

Speaking to Cointelegraph, Sawhney emphasized the fact that Hosho has been actively increasing scales of automated tooling implementation, while at the same time seeing a much smaller number of smart contracts audits.

In this context, auditing work by a large number of engineers has become unnecessary, Sawhney said, stressing that the main goal now is to keep the company going.

Sawhney noted that Hosho intends to figure out the perfect number of employees that should be kept in the company, at the same time maintaining and developing the momentum of the work, as well as its brand and level of audit reports.

In late 2018, Cointelegraph reported on alleged layoffs at major blockchain software firm ConsenSys, with sources familiar with the matter claiming that the amount of employees that is set to be fired is anywhere between 50 and 60 percent out of the entire team of 1,200 people.
