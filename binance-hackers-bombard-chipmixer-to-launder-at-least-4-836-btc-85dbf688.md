At least 4,836 Bitcoin (BTC) of stolen from Binance exchange in May 2019 was laundered through crypto mixing service Chipmixer.

## Attackers started laundering the stolen funds in a month after the hack

Following a major Binance’s security breach that resulted in a loss of 7,000 BTC (more than $80 million at press time), hackers started to launder the stolen funds on June 12, 2019, according to research published by Luxembourg-based crypto capital flow firm Clain.

## Hackers caused highest historic inflows on crypto tumbler Chipmixer

As Chain discovered, the funds stolen from Binance were directed to crypto tumbler Chipmixer, which reportedly experienced a historical high of fund inflows.

The research team estimated that the total amount of funds located in merged fund clusters accounted for more than 5,300 BTC.

Alongside that amount, 183 BTC were identified as hacker funds after attempted laundering, while another 814 BTC are likely to be confirmed as hacker funds, pending confirmation once those funds start moving.

Clain concluded that the attackers are actively trying to break up the direct relationship with the illegal sources by using Chipmixer, while there is no evidence to suggest that the hackers have transferred money to exchanges.

As previously reported, a crypto mixing service, or a crypto tumbler, is an anonymity tool that claims to transform transactions of non-private coins to private ones by mixing crypto funds with others, which makes it difficult to trace the funds’ original source.
