Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbene, ranked 16th on CoinMarketCap by adjusted volume, has announced it is undergoing maintenance on Tuesday, March 26, as the crypto industry discusses rumors that the exchange has been hacked.

The official Twitter account of Coinbene Global, @CoinBene, has responded to a user nicknamed Crypto James, who claims that his deposits have been pending for an hour and insists the exchange has suffered a hack, as the maintenance had not been previously announced.

Coinbene’s reply to his tweet reads:

“In order to enhance the user experience, CoinBene upgraded the platform wallet on March 26, 2019.

In another tweet, Coinbene adds that the completion time of the maintenance will be announced separately.

The exchange states that all withdrawals and deposits will be completed automatically after the maintenance concludes.

In a comment to Saponaro’s tweet, Twitter user Stephen Morrison noted that the funds appear to have been moved to an address commented on as “cold wallet.”

Nick Schteringard of Russian crypto media Forklog also mentioned “strange activity” on Coinbene in his Twitter.
