# AMD Earnings Surpass Target Amid Talk of Cryptocurrency Bull Market Return ...

###### 2019-05-01 06:05

United States transnational IT firm Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) over delivered on Wall Street expectations for earnings, the company confirmed in a press release on April 30.

AMD, which had previously seen volatility in its performance amid challenging 2018 market conditions, posted an adjusted share price of $0.06, 1 cent above the target.

The knock-on effect among investors was immediately palpable, with the company’s share price spiking more than 5% in the hours after the data was published.

She added:

“We look forward to the upcoming launches of our next-generation 7nm PC, gaming and datacenter products which we expect to drive further market share gains and financial growth.”

Like many hardware manufacturers, AMD experienced a rocky 2018, a situation made worse by the persisting cryptocurrency bear market, which reduced demand for associated mining hardware components.

As Cointelegraph reported, experts had warned the crypto winter could continue to cause a headache for the company, along with others such as Nvidia, which has nonetheless also seen a reversal in its fortunes for Q1 2019.

Bitcoin (BTC), meanwhile, continues to trade above $5,000, buoying sentiment that the bear market is definitively over after holding on to support around that level throughout April.
