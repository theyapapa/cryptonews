American retail giant Walmart has submitted a patent application for a drone communication system that is based on blockchain technology.

Walmart filed its patent with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) on Aug. 1.

The filing describes a system on a drone that encrypts and stores that drone’s operational parameters.

In essence, the vehicle-to-vehicle communication system between unmanned drones would relay messages, mesh communications networks and allow machines to be aware of each others’ location and bearing.

## Walmart’s venture into blockchain patents

Walmart has been engaged in patenting blockchain solutions for drones since at least 2017.

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Walmart filed a patent application with the USPTO in May 2017 for a system of “Unmanned Aerial Delivery to Secure Location.”

## IBM has similar aims

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, IBM also submitted a patent application with the USPTO in 2017 for a system that would secure drone communications by storing and sharing information via blockchain tech.
