# Price Analysis 31/07: BTC, ETH, XRP, LTC, BCH, BNB, EOS, BSV, XLM, ADA ...

###### 2019-07-31 15:07

## ETH/USD

After holding the uptrend line for the past few days, Ether (ETH) has started a recovery.

The next dip might break below the uptrend line because it will force the aggressive bulls to liquidate their long positions.

Our assumption will be negated if bears defend the overhead resistance and sink the BCH/USD pair below the uptrend line.

Therefore, we might suggest long positions if the BNB/USD pair sustains above the uptrend line for three days.

## XLM/USD

The price action of the past three days shows that neither the bulls nor the bears are taking any directional bet.

If the price fails to escape these levels, the pair might end up forming a range for the next few days.

As the pair is not in an uptrend and we are trying to take a reversal trade, we suggest traders keep the position size at 50% of usual.
