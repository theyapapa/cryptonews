# BIS Report Finds Strong Link Between Crypto Prices and Regulators' Actions ...

A new report published by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has found a strong correlation between crypto prices and news of regulators’ interventions.

According to the report published September 23 by BIS – an organization based in Switzerland made up of 60 of the world’s central banks – cryptocurrencies retain close links to news of regulatory actions across different national jurisdictions.

The report found that the markets responded most markedly to news events regarding the legal status of crypto.

Adverse market responses were found to news that pertains to bans, the possible applicability of securities market law to crypto assets, or to announcements that crypto will not be recognized as a currency.

The report also found that announcements regarding anti-money laundering/combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) measures – or other interventions that “limit the interoperability of crypto with the regulated financial system” – have a strong adverse impact on the markets.

BIS noted that non-specific – or general – warnings against the risks of crypto, as well as announcements pertaining to the possible, but indeterminate, issuance of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), had a negligible effect on crypto price action.

In summary, BIS proposed that regulation “need not be bad news for the \[crypto\] markets, with price responses notably signalling a clear preference for a defined legal status, albeit a light regulatory regime.”
