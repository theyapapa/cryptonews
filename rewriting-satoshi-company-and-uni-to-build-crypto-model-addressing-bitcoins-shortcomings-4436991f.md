SovereignWallet says it will be collaborating with the University of Southern California’s Viterbi School of Engineering to develop the project, which has been named the MUI Meta-Blockchain.

## Completing Satoshi’s vision

According to SovereignWallet, the MUI Meta-Blockchain is the first to fully embrace Nakamoto’s philosophy.

In a blog post explaining the rationale behind this monetary system, and why it would benefit the world, the SovereignWallet team said: “If anyone can issue money and adjust their price competitiveness through currency exchange adjustments, then we can properly adjust regional economic differences and competitive advantages between companies to create a society in which wealth is distributed more evenly.”

The MUI-Meta Blockchain would see a stable coin created that is based on the Algorithmic Central Bank system, coupled with decentralized cryptographic technology.

When all of SovereignWallet’s services are combined, the goal is to ensure that it is “easy for everyone to mint their own community currencies, pegged to stable currencies” — all without needing to build their own blockchain.

On its website, SovereignWallet describes its hybrid approach as “Blockchain 3.0,” a network that capitalizes on recent advances in blockchain technology while addressing some of the downsides that have surfaced during the first two iterations, such as immense energy requirements, slow transaction speeds, programming errors and security concerns surrounding smart contracts.

Overall, as well as ensuring that wealth is more evenly distributed, SovereignWallet is motivated by financial inclusion — creating an ecosystem where hundreds of millions of people without bank accounts and speaking dozens of languages have the opportunity to create cryptocurrencies which are well-matched to their needs.
