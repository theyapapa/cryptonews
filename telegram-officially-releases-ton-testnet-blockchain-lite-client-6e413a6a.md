Encrypted instant messaging service Telegram has officially released a test client for its Telegram Open Network (TON), according to files posted on test.ton.org.

The newly introduced archive of files available for download is a distribution of a preliminary version of the TON Blockchain Network Lite Client along with the relevant portions of the TON Blockchain Library, according to the readme information file.

Per the readme file on GitHub, the client — if configured properly — connected to a full node for the TON blockchain testnet and sent some queries to it.

Apart from the Lite Client itself, users can also install a configuration file for smart contract development, which connects the lite client to a special server.

Users can also deploy Fift to compile, execute, and debug smart contracts locally, the file reads.

The language is specifically designed for developing and managing TON blockchain smart contracts, and interacting with the TON Virtual Machine.

Telegram reportedly launched a private beta testing of the TON blockchain to a limited number of global developers in April.
