# ECB Official: Stablecoins Pose Risks to Public Policy Priorities ...

A board member of the European Central Bank (ECB) has argued that stablecoins like Facebook’s long-awaited Libra coin pose risks to public policy priorities.

ECB board member Benoit Coeure delivered his comments on stablecoins’ regulatory issues at a meeting at the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) in Basel, Switzerland, Reuters reported on Sept. 16.

Coeure specifically stated:

“Stablecoins are largely untested, especially on the scale required to run a global payment system.

## 26 global central banks and Libra

The event at the BIS hosted 26 global central banks and the team behind the Libra project to assess the financial stability risks of the project.

The event was reportedly the first major encounter between Libra’s founders and global policymakers since Facebook revealed its plans for the stablecoin project on June 18.

Previously, Coeure stipulated that the Libra coin will not launch until global regulators are satisfied.

## Response from the Libra team

Amid the ongoing meeting between Libra founders and the global central banks in Basel, Calibra CEO David Marcus stepped up to protect the position of the Libra Association.
