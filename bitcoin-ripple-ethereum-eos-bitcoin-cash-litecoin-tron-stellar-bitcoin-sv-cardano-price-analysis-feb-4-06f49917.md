While some are predicting the end of cryptocurrencies, the co-founder and CEO of Twitter Jack Dorsey has projected a very bullish future for Bitcoin (BTC).

A breakdown from the critical support levels will extend the bear market, while a sharp move up could signal a probable bottom.

On the other hand, if the bulls scale above the 20-day EMA, the BTC/USD pair will rise to the 50-day SMA.

Conversely, if the bulls defend the support at $0.27795 and push the price above the 50-day SMA, the XRP/USD pair is likely to pick up momentum.

If the bulls fail to break out and sustain above the overhead resistance, the bears will again attempt to sink the pair below the 20-day EMA.

Nevertheless, if the XLM/USD pair turns around from the current levels and rises above the 20-day EMA and the 50-day SMA, it can reach $0.13427050.

## BSV/USD

Bitcoin SV has been clinging on to the support at $65.031 for the past seven days.
