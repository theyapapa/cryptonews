Cybersecurity firm Trend Micro has detected a major uptick in monero (XMR) cryptojacking malware targeting China-based systems this spring.

As previously reported, cryptojacking is an industry term for stealth crypto mining attacks that work by installing malware that uses a computer’s processing power to mine for cryptocurrencies without the owner’s consent or knowledge.

In an analysis of the attacks, the cybersecurity firm identified that this latest campaign resembles a previous wave of activities that used an obfuscated PowerShell script (dubbed “PCASTLE”) to deliver XMR-mining malware.

Trend Micro’s report describes in detail how the malware’s infection chain functions, and notes that while the campaign is focused on one geographic area, it seems to be indiscriminate in terms of industry.

Trend Micro also notes that alongside their cross-industry target field, the attackers’:

“Use of XMRig as their payload’s miner module is \[...\] not surprising.

In its conclusion, Trend Micro notes that even while the motivations behind the attackers’ focus on China remain unclear, the campaign demonstrates that fileless malware techniques represent a persistent threat — one of the most prevalent in the current landscape, according to the firm.

As reported earlier this month, Trend Micro also detected a malware dubbed BlackSquid that infects web servers by employing eight different security exploits and installs XMRig monero Central Processing Unit-based mining software.
