American cryptocurrency exchange and wallet service Coinbase announced that it has released aggregated data in the form of three trading signals to its customers.

Coinbase announced the new offerings in an official blog post on July 17.

The three trading signals that are being offered are top holder activity, typical hold time and popularity, and price correlation.

The purported aim of each of these offerings is to allow investors to create more informed trading strategies, by means of insights that go beyond raw price metrics.

The typical hold time signal, for instance, tracks the median number of days that a given asset is held before it is moved via a new transaction.

Coinbase also notes that the metrics will be offered alongside traditional market data, which it has already been providing.

Coinbase drew on data from a survey that collected responses from 2,000 participants this year.
