Cryptocurrency asset manager LedgerX has launched a Bitcoin (BTC) price volatility index called LedgerX Volatility Index (LXVX) that will function as a “bitcoin fear index,” similar to how the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) works for the stock markets.

On the other hand, if the bears push the price lower from the current levels and break below $2.1733, a fall to $1.7746 and $1.55 will be on the cards.

If the price takes support at the 20-day EMA, the bulls will attempt to break out of the range again.

Still, if the bulls fail to scale the overhead resistance, a fall to 20-day EMA, followed by a drop to the critical support at $0.0183 is probable.

## ADA/USD

The bulls have failed to sustain Cardano (ADA) above the 20-day EMA for the past six days, but the positive thing is that the price has not given up much ground.

If the ADA/USD pair breaks out of the 20-day EMA, a rally to $0.051468, followed by a move to the resistance line of the ascending channel, will be probable.

On the other hand, if the virtual currency turns down from the current levels, it can correct to the 50-day SMA, and below that to $0.036815, which is close to the support line of the channel.
