# Polish Bank Verifies Documents With Ethereum Blockchain ...

###### 2019-06-17 18:06

Alior Bank, a bank based in Warsaw, Poland, is using the public Ethereum blockchain to authenticate its clients’ documents, according to a report by Forbes on June 17.

According to the report, when a client at Alior receives a document, they can now verify its authenticity by following a website link to its spot on the public blockchain.

The blockchain technology lead at Alior, Piotr Adamczyk, explains:

“We know exactly in which block of Ethereum the document with a given hash is published.

Alior reportedly developed this blockchain solution in response to changing regulations in Poland, where the Office of Competition and Consumer Protection ruled in 2017 that website pages do not constitute a “durable medium” necessary for issuing customer documents — the issue being that website pages are too easily changed, making them not suitably durable.

Thus, Alior came up with a blockchain solution that provides online documentation through a suitably durable medium.

Moreover, Alior management reportedly believes it is the first bank to use a public, as opposed to a private, blockchain for customer service.

According to a recent analysis by Cointelegraph, banks in South Korea are increasingly making use of blockchain tech, from solutions in document verifications to peer-to-peer services; however, the country’s banks are not deploying cryptocurrency services.
