We can expect a new uptrend if the bulls breakout and close (UTC time frame) above the channel.

A quick breakout of the channel will turn it into a bullish flag, which has a pattern target of $355, with a minor resistance at $307.1.

Short-term traders can benefit from this move by being on the long side of the markets.

However, if the bears fail to breakout of the channel and the 50-day SMA, the BCH/USD pair can again turn down to the bottom of the channel.

If the LTC/USD pair turns down from current levels, it can slip back to $28.067 and if this support breaks, a retest of the lows is probable.

We have been positive on the TRX/USD pair for the past few days because it has bounced sharply from the lows and has sustained the higher levels.

Conversely, if the ADA/USD pair turns down from current levels and breaks below $0.036815, it can retest the lows.
