The President of the Republic of the Marshall Islands Hilda Heine has narrowly survived a no confidence vote that was partly prompted by her plans to introduce a national digital currency, Asia-focused English-language publication Nikkei Asian Review reports Nov. 12.

The country’s parliament had initially backed the creation of a national digital currency, called the Sovereign (SOV), in February of this year, to be distributed and used along with the U.S. dollar, the country’s mainstream currency.

However, as Nikkei notes, the president’s critics had accused the proposed plan for a state-backed cryptocurrency of “tarnishing” the country’s reputation.

Nemra reportedly stoked political divisions over the government’s alleged failure to investigate investigate the loss of $1 billion from the Marshall Islands Trust Fund, which set up by the U.S. to compensate Marshallese citizens affected by nuclear tests conducted near the country.

Several of the senators who introduced the no confidence vote support the plan, while Heine sees the move as a Chinese incursion on Marshallese sovereignty.

As both Nikkei and major Israeli newspaper Haaretz report, the Marshallese government’s pursuit of a state-backed cryptocurrency was precipitated by a partnership with Israeli startup Neema, which is said to have persuaded the country’s politicians that the project could bring $30 million, of which half would go to Neema.

As previously reported, this September, the IMF warned the Marshallese government of the risks of adopting a cryptocurrency as a second legal tender, stating that "the potential benefits from revenue gains appear considerably smaller than the potential costs."
