United States startup VaultTel has introduced a hardware cryptocurrency wallet designed to fit in a mobile phone SIM card tray, a press release from the company reveals on March 6.

The solution reportedly combines a mobile application and a hardware chip, dubbed the VaultTel Card.

According to the firm, users can lock the VaultTel Card to a single device and to a particular geographical location.

To store funds, customers can either insert the VaultTel Card inside an unused SIM card tray — in the case of dual SIM capacity — or connect the chip to their phone via an accessory, such as a dongle.

In February, after weeks of rumours and speculations, South Korean tech giant Samsung officially announced at the Mobile World Congress that its new smartphone, the Galaxy S10, will include a digital wallet that supports Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), COSMEE’s token (COSM) and Enjin’s token (ENJ).

In January, cryptocurrency hardware wallet firm Ledger presented its new Bluetooth-based wallet, Ledger Nano X, that has the capacity to store 100 different crypto assets.

Later that month, the company released Ledger Live — a mobile app for Android and iOS that allows Nano X wallets owners to use their wallet without the need for a cable via their mobile device and a Bluetooth connection.
