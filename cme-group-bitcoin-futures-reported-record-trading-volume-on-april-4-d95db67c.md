The CME Bitcoin Futures, according to a dedicated frequently asked questions page, were launched on December 17, 2017, and started trading the next day.

Last month, news broke that also United Kingdom-based crypto exchange and futures provider Crypto Facilities had seen its trading volumes grow by over 500% after being acquired by crypto exchange Kraken.

As Cointelegraph reported in March, CME Group told Business Insider that Bitcoinâ€™s finite amount is a challenge for regulators.

In March, a Commodity Futures Trading Commission commissioner revealed that the U.S. regulator is actively working to approve multiple crypto-related applications, including for Bitcoin futures from institutional trading platform Bakkt.
