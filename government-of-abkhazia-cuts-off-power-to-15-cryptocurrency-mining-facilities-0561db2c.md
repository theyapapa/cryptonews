The government of the Republic of Abkhazia has cut power to some cryptocurrency mining farms due to electricity concerns, state electric utility Chernomorenergo RUE announced in a Facebook post on Dec. 31.

Per the announcement, Chernomorenergo cut power to 15 facilities with a total capacity of 8,950 kilowatt-hours (kWh), which is purportedly equivalent to the electricity consumption of 1,800 households.

Regulators worldwide have expressed concerns over the cryptocurrency mining industryâ€™s electricity consumption.

In November, Norway ended electricity subsidies for Bitcoin (BTC) mining facilities.

In the United States, the Chelan County Public Utility District of the state of Washington proposed a new electricity pricing structure for cryptocurrency miners meant to pass down the cost of increased electricity demand.

As Cointelegraph reported in October, Bitcoin miner revenues for the first six months of 2018 had surpassed results in 2017, but miners themselves saw little profit, according to weekly crypto outlet Diar.

The severe cryptocurrency market decline reportedly caused a new generation miners to start hedging their coins to avoid market risks.
