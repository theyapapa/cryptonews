San Francisco-based crypto lending and borrowing firm Dharma has announced the start of a closed beta for a new version of its platform.

## Upcoming changes and short-term timeline

Dharma announced its new platform iteration in an official blog post on Aug. 29.

According to the announcement, Dharma has partnered with the Ethereum-based money market Compound and will reportedly use its protocol as infrastructure for the new platform.

Moreover, Dharma announced a number of new features they aim to push out including a non-custodial and multisig smart wallet, dedicated deposit addresses, and frictionless fiat on-ramps and off-ramps.

## Previous issues and a new chapter

According to the announcement, Dharma decided to start from scratch on its platform due to technical issues and security concerns.

As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Dharma ultimately moved to halt new deposits and loans on its platform at the beginning of August, but promised that an exciting new chapter was coming soon.

The company wrote:

â€œFor now, we're pausing new deposits and loans in Dharma.
