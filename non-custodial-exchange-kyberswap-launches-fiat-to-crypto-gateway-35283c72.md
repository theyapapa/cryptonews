Non-custodial exchange KyberSwap has launched fiat-to-crypto gateway in collaboration with cryptocurrency exchange Coindirect.

According to a Sept. 13 blog post, KyberSwap’s users can now buy digital currencies directly with fiat currencies, taking into account that the exchange currently supports trading of Ether (ETH) and ERC-20 tokens only.

The partnership with MakerDAO-backed third-party service Coindirect enables KyberSwap’s customers to purchase cryptocurrencies using Visa and MasterCard credit and debit cards.

## Other industry players offering fiat-to-crypto

KyberSwap thus joined the ranks of other industry projects supporting fiat-to-cryptocurrency trading.

At the beginning of the year, major cryptocurrency exchange Binance expanded to European markets with the launch of a new platform for fiat-to-cryptocurrency trading dubbed Binance Jersey.

Later in July, Binance announced further expansion of its fiat-enabled trading platform in Singapore, but with limited functionalities and only one trading pair.

This spring, Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange Zebpay expanded its trading services to Australia allowing its customers to trade across five fiat-to-crypto trading pairs including Bitcoin (BTC), ETH, XRP, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Litecoin (LTC) both on desktop and Android and iOS apps.
