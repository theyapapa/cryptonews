The Winklevoss brothers’ cryptocurrency exchange Gemini has hired Noah Perlman, a former executive at financial services giant Morgan Stanley, as its new chief compliance officer.

Per an official announcement published by Tyler Winklevoss on Sept. 4, Perlman joined Gemini after 13 years at Morgan Stanley, where he worked as global head of financial crimes and global head of special investigations.

## Legal and compliance background

The announcement states that Perlman had “firm-wide, legal and compliance responsibility for the governance, oversight, and execution of the firm’s anti-money laundering, sanctions, anti-boycott, anti-corruption, and government and political activities programs.”

According to Perlman’s profile on professional social network LinkedIn, prior to joining Morgan Stanley he worked as an Assistant United States Attorney at the U.S. Attorney Office of the Eastern District of New York and as a division counsel at the Drug Enforcement Administration.

## Building its presence

In mid-August, Gemini hired cybersecurity expert David Damato as its new chief security officer.

Damato previously created and led a cybersecurity team at security services firm Tanium.

In June, Gemini opened up offices in Chicago that will serve as an engineering hub to support trading and custody operations.
