On the other hand, if the bears break below the critical support of $5,900, it might result in panic selling, dragging the pair to the lower levels of $5,000–$5,450.

The first sign of a trend will be when the ETH/USD pair escapes the tight range of $188.35–$249.93.

## XRP/USD

Ripple is finding support just above the moving averages, which is a positive sign.

The next support level on the downside is $460, and if this level breaks, a complete retracement of the recent rally to $410.2768 is probable.

If the XLM/USD pair breaks above the channel, it is likely to pick up momentum, break out of the immediate resistance at $0.304, and rally towards its target objective of $0.36.

If the bulls fail to scale the moving average, Monero is likely to drop to the bottom of the tight range at $100.453.

However, if the bears break below the bottom of the tight range, a drop to the critical support at $0.0183 is probable.
