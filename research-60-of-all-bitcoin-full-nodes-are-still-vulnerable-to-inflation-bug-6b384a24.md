# Research: 60% of All Bitcoin Full-Nodes Are Still Vulnerable to Inflation Bug ...

According to bitcoin (BTC) node stats reported on the website of bitcoin core developer Luke Dashjr, 60.22% of the coin’s full-nodes are running software still vulnerable to the inflation bug at press time.

According to the reported data, the software running on 60,101 bitcoin full-nodes is vulnerable to the CVE-2018-17144 bug.

As Cointelegraph reported at the end of September last year, the bug allows malicious miners to artificially inflate bitcoin’s supply via a simple type of double input.

According to a Cointelegraph analysis, at the time — likely because of the possible catastrophic consequences of the presence of the bug — the developers decided to keep it a secret and only revealed that the bug made the network vulnerable to Distributed Denial of Service attacks.

The stats on Dashjr’s website also claim that there are 99,638 bitcoin full-nodes currently running at press time, a number about ten times higher than reported by most bitcoin analytics platforms.

For instance, BitNodes claims that there are now 9,515 bitcoin full nodes, while CoinDance reports that there are only 9,391 nodes running at press time.

Dashjr’s chart of bitcoin nodes is based on four weeks of data and is updated hourly.
