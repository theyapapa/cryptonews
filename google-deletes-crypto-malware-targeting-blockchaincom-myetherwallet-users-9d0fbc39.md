# Google Deletes Crypto Malware Targeting Blockchain.com, MyEtherWallet Users ...

A Google Chrome browser extension tricking users into participating in a fake airdrop from cryptocurrency exchange Huobi claimed over 200 victims, a security researcher reported in a blog post on March 14.

The extension for Chrome web browser, with the name NoCoin, gained 230 downloads before Google deleted it, according to Harry Denley, who runs cryptocurrency scam database EtherscamDB.

Denley noted that hackers had purposely disguised the malicious extension to look like a tool protecting users from cryptocurrency malware or so-called cryptojacking.

Behind the facade, however, it became apparent the extension requests the input of private keys from popular wallet interfaces MyEtherWallet (MEW) and Blockchain.com.

The extension lay at the end of a fake giveaway campaign, ostensibly from crypto exchange Huobi, which offered worthless ERC20 Ethereum network-based tokens to unwitting consumers.

It is unknown how long the extension remained available for Google Chrome users.

As Cointelegraph reported last month, users of cryptocurrency wallets Electrum and MEW were also facing phishing attacks, according to posts published on Reddit and Twitter.
