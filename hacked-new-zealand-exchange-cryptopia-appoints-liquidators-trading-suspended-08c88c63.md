# Hacked New Zealand Exchange Cryptopia Appoints Liquidators, Trading Suspended ...

###### 2019-05-15 04:05

Hacked New Zealand-based cryptocurrency exchange Cryptopia has appointed David Ruscoe and Russell Moore from consultancy and audit firm network Grant Thornton New Zealand as liquidators.

Grant Thornton New Zealand (NZ) is the local network of Grant Thornton International — a major professional services network of independent accounting and consulting member firms.

As Cointelegraph has reported in mid-January of this year, Cryptopia revealed that it had been the target of a security breach resulting in significant losses, with the attack continuing for two weeks after its initial detection until the exchange managed to regain control of its wallets.

According to Grant Thornton NZ, Cryptopia has decided to go into liquidation as it has been unable to return the business to profitability, notwithstanding management’s reported efforts to reduce costs.

Ruscoe added that given the complexities of the case, Grant Thornton NZ expects the investigation “to take months rather than weeks.”

Grant Thornton NZ will publish an initial report to the New Zealand Companies Office website next week.

An analysis from blockchain infrastructure firm Elementus estimated in February that as much as $16 million worth of ethereum (ETH) and ERC-20 tokens were siphoned from the platform during the attack — $3.2 million of which were later traced in liquidations on exchanges such as Etherdelta, Binance and Bitbox.
