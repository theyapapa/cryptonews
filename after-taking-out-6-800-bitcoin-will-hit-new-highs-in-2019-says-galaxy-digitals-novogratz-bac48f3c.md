Galaxy Digital CEO Michael Novogratz delivered a fresh bullish price prediction for Bitcoin (BTC) Nov. 5.

Novogratz told U.K. business publication Financial News that the leading cryptocurrency could hit highs of “$20,000 or more” in 2019.

Speaking to the publication, Novogratz, who is well known for his optimistic outlook for Bitcoin prices, forecast BTC/USD to end this year at around $8,900.

“Bitcoin has to take out $6,800, and after that we could end the year at $8,800-9,000,” he said.

Next year, however, conditions should change markedly, says Novogratz, with institutional investors’ “FOMO” (‘fear of missing out’) causing a surge in prices.

Novogratz had previously made similar predictions last month, specifically targeting the first half of 2019 for institutional interest and a December 2018 Bitcoin price not higher than $9,000.

Lee also continues his buoyant outlook for Bitcoin in the short term, telling Cointelegraph in an interview that the coin was “preparing to break out.”
