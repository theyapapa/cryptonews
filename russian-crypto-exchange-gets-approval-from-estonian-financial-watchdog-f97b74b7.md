Russian cryptocurrency exchange B2BX has received regulatory approval from the Estonian Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) to operate in the country, according to a press release published Nov. 12.

Founded in 2014, B2BX is a part of the B2Broker group of companies and a full-featured spot trading platform, offering 34 cryptocurrency markets.

The recently obtained FIU license will allow B2BX to operate as a completely regulated exchange for trading digital currencies, as well as provide an extended level of crypto-to-crypto and “soon” crypto-to-fiat services.

According to the release, B2BX is one of the first crypto exchanges to receive such recognition in Europe.

The announcement also says that with the new license, the exchange’s customers will get increased automatic deposit and withdrawal daily limits, in addition to exchange and withdrawal facilities in fiat currencies through bank transfer and all major payment service providers.

Arthur Azizov, CEO and founder of B2Broker group said:

“We are delighted to have secured regulatory approval from Estonia, placing B2BX Exchange in the enviable position of being one of the first exchanges to achieve this accolade.

The country subsequently implemented an online voting system during national elections and involved a number of public service projects that are backed by blockchain, including health services.
