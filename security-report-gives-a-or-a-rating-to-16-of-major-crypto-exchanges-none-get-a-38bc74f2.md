# Security Report Gives A or A- Rating to 16% of Major Crypto Exchanges, None Get A+ ...

###### 2019-01-16 10:01

The latest Exchange Security Report from independent analysts at ICORating has given 16 percent of the world’s biggest crypto trading platforms an A rating, and none of them an A+.

ICORating assessed 135 crypto trading platforms, all of whose daily trade value reportedly exceeds $100,000, on the basis of four security categories: user account security, registrar and domain security, web security and DoS attack protection.

No exchanges sealed an A+ ratings, two exchanges (representing 1.5 percent) received a solid A rating, and 16 percent fell within A or A- category.

The analysts’ four security categories were further subdivided into a range of concrete testing parameters; for user security, the report assessed four criteria — including password security and two-factor authentication — finding that just 22 percent met all four.

Web security, which was analyzed on the basis of 10 criteria — including protection from clickjacking attacks, man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack protection and HSTS header presence — was a more checkered picture.

Protection against Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks was more widespread, with 74 percent of all exchanges considered to be safe.

ICORating’s data ranked crypto exchange Coinbase Pro ninth with an A- rating — with crypto derivatives platform BitMEX ranking fourth (A-), Bitfinex fourth (A-) and HitBTC 13th (A-).
