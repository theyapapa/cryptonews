The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) has budgeted over 1 million euro for monitoring fintech and crypto assets, according to a document published Oct. 4.

Founded in 2011 in Paris, the ESMA has an objective to develop a uniform rulebook for European Union (E.U.) financial markets, as well as provide market supervision.

In its 2019 Annual Work Program, the ESMA cites a 1.1 million euro program and its objectives for the next year, which include regulation and supervisory treatment of new financial activities, focusing on fintech and crypto assets.

Within the announced framework, the ESMA will identify risks related to such activities and trends, and provide relevant advice and proposals where needed.

Additionally, the ESMA has set a goal to provide guidance and facilitate the implementation of the Markets and Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) in order to make markets more transparent.

The program will:

“Achieve a coordinated approach to the regulation and supervisory treatment of new or innovative financial activities and provide advice to present to the E.U. institutions, market participants or consumers.”

"Due to the specific characteristics of cryptocurrencies as an asset class the market for financial instruments providing exposure to cryptocurrencies, such as CFDs, will be closely monitored, and ESMA will assess whether stricter measures are required," the regulator explained.
