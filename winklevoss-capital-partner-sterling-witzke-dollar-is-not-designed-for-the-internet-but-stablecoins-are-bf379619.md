As you know from the slogans, Gemini is very pro-thoughtful regulation and believes that consumers in the crypto space deserve the same protection as consumers in other industries.

## Investors are dipping their toes in crypto, no one is taking the plunge

AB: As far as we know, Winklevoss Capital is mostly focused on the investments and the institutional side of the business.

## Crypto markets face healthy corrections, as any emerging industry

AB: CNBCâ€™s Brian Kelly once compared crypto regulations to a ski track.

## Bitcoin is a store of value, not a speculative asset

AB: What, in your opinion, is a fair price for Bitcoin?

## Stablecoins are designed for internet payments

AB: As per recent studies, the era of ICO craziness is now over.

The Gemini dollar is 100 percent backed by the U.S. dollar, and it's the only stablecoin that has actually released their banking partner, State Street, and are very upfront about that.
