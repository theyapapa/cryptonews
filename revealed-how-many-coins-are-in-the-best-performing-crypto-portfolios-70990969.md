###### 2018-10-01 13:10

A platform designed to help investors keep track of their cryptocurrency trades and the performance of portfolios has revealed some of the biggest trends they have learned during their five years in operation.

To commemorate its anniversary, CoinTracking revealed how it has noticed that the trade behavior of its users intensifies when the price of a coin rises – with their analysis indicating that the best-performing portfolios hold between seven and twelve coins at any given time.

Since it was founded in 2013, the company says it has been struck by how many exchanges make it difficult for investors to analyze their trades, in part because these platforms fail to offer insights on realized or unrealized gains.

## Features for every type of user

CoinTracking says that it aims to appeal to users of all levels – ranging from casual traders to more experienced investors.

As the name suggests, the Unlimited plan is free of restrictions – and offers other features such as exports in six file types, prioritized caching and faster calculations, a daily backup of all trades and guaranteed access to all future platform updates.

Not only does it offer trends for each of these coins, but CoinTracking says it provides nine years of historical data to help investors make informed decisions – including interactive charts and a calculation of key indicators.

People who currently use other prominent crypto exchanges and wallets can also import data with ease, and use an intuitive search feature which groups trades by the exchange where they were executed.
