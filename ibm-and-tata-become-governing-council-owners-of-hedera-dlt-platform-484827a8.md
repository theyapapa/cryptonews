Public distributed ledger Hedera Hashgraph has announced that IBM and Tata Communications have joined its governing council.

## “Diverse array” of council members

Mance Harmon, the CEO of Hedera Hashgraph, said IBM and Tata Communications’ presence further decentralizes the platform’s governance, adding:

“Our governance model, which includes a robust system of checks and balances, ensures power can’t be consolidated, while at the same time providing a stable and scalable platform on which developers can build.”

Up to 39 multinational entities will make up the Hedera Governing Council.

A “diverse array” of enterprises from telecommunications, retail, law, financial services and technology are now represented on the council, Hedera said.

This governing council will be key in Hedera’s success says Leemon Baird, the company's co-founder and chief scientist.

## IBM and Tata “excited” to join

IBM’s vice president of blockchain technologies, Jerry Cuomo, described Hedera as the “de facto standard enterprises use to build, manage and deploy blockchain-based ledgers” — adding that he believes the platform could enhance and simplify the deployment of Hyperledger Fabric in enterprise environments.

Ankur Jindal, global head of corporate venturing and innovation and Tata Communications, expressed excitement at the prospect of joining other forward-looking businesses to deliver the potential of distributed ledger technology (DLT) to the wider economy.
