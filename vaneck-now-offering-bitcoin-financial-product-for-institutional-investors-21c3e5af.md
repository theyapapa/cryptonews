The CEO of investment management firm VanEck Associates, Jan Van Eck, said that the company is now offering a type financial product with exposure to Bitcoin (BTC).

In an interview with CNBC on Sept. 11, Van Eck said that the product offered by the firm is a broker-traded fund and is currently not available to the public, but to institutional investors only.

The broker-traded fund is called VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust 144A Shares.

## Caveats to get exposure to Bitcoin

Qualified investors that are eligible to purchase the product must be an institution that has $100 million.

When asked about the significance of the firm’s product and whether it represented a kind of breakthrough for the industry, Van Eck addressed regulatory issues regarding cryptocurrency and traditional exchanges.

The interview follows yesterday’s news that VanEck Associates issued just four Bitcoins via the new product.

Industry lawyer Jake Chervinsky recently argued that the product did not represent a legal Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), something which is still under consideration by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
