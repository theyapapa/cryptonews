# Post-Trade Market Infrastructure Giant DTCC Publishes Guidelines for Tokenized Securities ...

The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), a global post-trade market infrastructure giant, has published a white paper outlining guiding principles for the post-trade processing of tokenized securities.

The paper — targeted at regulators and other market participants — identifies the characteristics that are unique to the emerging tokenized security asset class and its market structure.

In the press release, DTCC proposes that:

“The market for trading crypto assets that are security tokens where the post-trade processing uses distributed ledger technology (DLT), has created a need for safety, security and reliability around these transactions to protect market stability.”

DTCC deems that global policy standards for traditional market infrastructures are often applicable, and broadly useful for stakeholders to identify the legal and other types of responsibilities that pertain to a security token platform offering post-trade services.

The white paper cites the example of “Principles for financial market infrastructures,” or PFMIs, as offering useful guidance for determining such post-trade responsibilities.

In such cases, DTCC advises regulators, security token platform operators, and other market participants to determine legal and other requirements based on the platform’s functions and services — and the prospective risks involved.

The white paper continues by transposing relevant, international standards for traditional post-trade responsibilities worldwide into the context of security tokens and crypto assets, identifying the key principles that must be enforced in order to foster market stability and investor confidence.
