Belarus has launched a trading platform that enables customers to buy tokenized versions of shares, gold and other traditional assets, Reuters reported Jan. 15.

According to Reuters, the government of Belarus has not yet commented on the launch of the platform, but it was covered by the state news agency BelTa.

The platform will allow traders to buy shares, precious metals, foreign exchange and other traditional assets from Belarus, as well as from other countries, with cryptocurrencies.

Since its launch, the platform has reportedly issued 150 different types of tokens, with each corresponding to a traditional financial instrument.

According to the Reutersâ€™ article, the government of Belarus has exempted transactions with tokenized securities from taxation until 2023.

Reuters reported that the platform received 2,000 registration applications within the first two hours from launch.

On Jan. 3, 2019, Estonian trading platform DX Exchange announced a product similar to the one that was launched by Belarus.
