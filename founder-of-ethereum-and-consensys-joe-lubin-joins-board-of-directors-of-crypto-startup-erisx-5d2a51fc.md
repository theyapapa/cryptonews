Founder of blockchain tech company ConsenSys Joseph Lubin has been appointed to the board of directors of cryptocurrency startup ErisX.

Cryptocurrency exchange ErisX is a reboot of a futures market Eris Exchange, originally established in 2010.

According to today’s announcement, Lubin has joined ErisX’s board of directors along with fintech entrepreneur Cris Conde.

Cris Conde, prior to joining ErisX, was a co-founder of software company Devon Systems, which in 1987 was acquired by SunGard, a provider of software for the financial industry.

Last month, ErisX announced the appointment of veteran exchange founder Matt Trudeau as its chief strategy officer (CSO).

In October, retail brokerage firm TD Ameritrade, along with investing company DRW Holdings and high-speed trader Virtu Financial announced their backing of ErisX.

The parties reportedly agreed to become market makers for ErisX, which is expected to ensure a deep order book for the exchange.
