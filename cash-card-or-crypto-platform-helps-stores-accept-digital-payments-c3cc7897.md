# Cash, Card or Crypto? — Platform Helps Stores Accept Digital Payments ...

A mobile crypto payment platform says its technology is transforming the retail business — and giving merchants an unprecedented opportunity to accept digital currencies as a method of payment.

However, the Slovenian startup says crypto can offer a much-needed alternative to the status quo — and stop physical stores from being left behind as online merchants give their shoppers a greater choice of payment methods.

Through Elipay, merchants can accept Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin, Ether and ELI tokens (its native currency) via a platform that can be simply integrated into their existing infrastructure.

## Taking crypto mainstream

Eligma says its Elipay point-of-sale solutions are designed to make it possible for merchants of all sizes to accept crypto, wherever they are based — in store or on the road.

Elipay is now accepted at more than 370 locations — with Eligma claiming that this means that its home country, Slovenia, has the highest number of crypto-friendly physical stores in the world.

The company has also played an instrumental role in creating Bitcoin City — a shopping mall where numerous major stores welcome digital currencies as a form of payment.

Clusters of merchants in specific locations will be invited to start using the technology, creating hubs where crypto consumers can shop — safe in the confidence that their digital currencies can be used to complete a purchase.
