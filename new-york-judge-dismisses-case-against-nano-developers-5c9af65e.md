# New York Judge Dismisses Case Against Nano Developers ...

###### 2018-10-23 19:10

A New York judge has thrown out an investor’s proposed class action lawsuit against the development team of altcoin Nano (XRB), according to court documents filed Oct. 22.

Initially, the lawsuit was filed in April by an American individual, Alex Brola, who reportedly bought $50,000 worth of XRB on Dec. 10, 2017, through Silver Miller law firm.

The suit accused Nano’s core team of violating U.S. securities laws by selling unregistered securities and negligently misrepresenting the reliability of Italian crypto exchange BitGrail, from which around 17 million XRB ($187 million at the time) was stolen in February.

In the lawsuit, Brola asked that Nano be ordered to “rescue fork” the investors’ missing XRB “into a new cryptocurrency in a manner that would fairly compensate the class of victims.”

Prior to Brola’s decision to withdraw the lawsuit, the defendants urged the New York federal court to dismiss the suit, claiming that the tokens are not securities and therefore are not subject to securities laws.

In a motion to dismiss filed in September, the XRB team stated that the cryptocurrency can not be classified as a security because the company had never gained any money in exchange for its insurance and has no investors.

Following the hack, both BitGrail and Nano have accused the other of being responsible for the $187 million theft of XRB tokens.
