# Scalable ‘Blockchain’ Network Seals $35 Million From Sequoia Capital, Huobi and Others ...

A new blockchain-type network led by a Turing Award recipient and other academics has sealed $35 million in funding from big-name investors that include Sequoia Capital.

Dr. Andrew Chi-Chih Yao, a Turing Award recipient who has earned the moniker of China’s “godfather of computer science,” is among those spearheading the Singapore-registered Conflux Foundation.

The network, dubbed “Conflux,” has been designed to tackle what is perceived to be blockchain’s biggest hurdle — scalability — proclaiming its new testnet to be capable of processing ”at least 6,500 Transactions Per Second (TPS), while supporting at least 20,000 nodes.”

Fellow co-founder Fan Long, a professor at the University of Toronto, told Fortune that:

“Conflux’s main idea is how to make the whole blockchain scalable.

The “main idea” entails using a directed acyclic graph (DAG): different from a blockchain in that it entails a topologically ordered system in which different types of transactions run on different chains in the network simultaneously.

Conflux combines DAG with a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm, and also allows network users to run smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps) on the network.

Long told Fortune that running smart contracts and DApps on a scalable, high-throughput protocol will enable both to gain traction beyond the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) space, and to extend to the finance and insurance sectors.
