Fully collateralized crypto-to-crypto lending platform Lendingblock has received a distributed ledger technology (DLT) provider license from Gibraltar Financial Services Commission (GFSC), reports Crowdfund Insider on Aug. 15.

## New capital lending model for digital assets

Providing collateralized lending and borrowing reportedly allows Lendingblock to support short-term trading, hedging and working capital needs.

This mirrors traditional financial markets, which the company aims to reinvent with a better model to service the digital asset lending market.

## Actively seeking regulatory approval

Gaining regulatory approval was an essential step for the company, involving a detailed and extensive process in collaboration with the GFSC.

Lendingblock CEO Steve Swain explained the company’s regulatory philosophy:

“We always put the needs of its institutional clients front and centre, so it was important for us to take the proactive step in becoming a regulated entity.”

Minister of Commerce, Albert Isola, said of the DLT provider license:

“It is 18 months since the DLT regulatory framework came into effect and we have seen a growing number of excellent companies and startups come to Gibraltar and work within this regulated framework.”

Earlier this month, Gibraltar awarded its first DLT license to a local cryptocurrency exchange.
