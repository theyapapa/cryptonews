The Free Democratic Party (FDP) in Germany proposes to issue a new cryptocurrency called Arbil to anyone who removes CO2 or other greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.

## Get paid to withdraw CO2 from the atmosphere

In a report by local news daily Welt on Sept. 2, the FDP recognizes that it is no longer enough to focus only on putting less CO2 into the atmosphere.

The party in the German Bundestag has now proposed to create a new digital currency with the motto "Put CO2 on the digital chain.‚Äù

He added:

"Anyone who withdraws CO2 from the atmosphere will be paid for it.

One Arbil coin would correspond to the certificate value for one ton of CO2, which is currently valued around $30.

Frank Sitta, Deputy Group Chairman of the FDP, said:

"We want to give CO2 a price worldwide.

## Crypto-incentivized climate action

In May, the United Nations signed a memorandum of understanding with nonprofit organization W-Foundation to promote global climate action projects, including compensating those who take climate action with cryptocurrencies.
