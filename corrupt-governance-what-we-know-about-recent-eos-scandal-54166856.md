# Corrupt Governance? What We Know About Recent EOS Scandal ...

Whilst BPs have the option to keep the tokens, they are also encouraged to reinvest them “to create better infrastructure growth, better community and financial support, along with better education on the EOS network and EOS dApps”, as blockchain analyst and tool builder Ben Sigman explains in a Medium post.

The supposedly democratic voting system soon showed its flaws: for instance, cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex secured its position as a block producer allegedly due to the votes of just few EOS holders, one of which accounted for 27 percent of all votes for Bitfinex, as community members pointed out on Reddit.

‘Mutual voting’, in turn, would imply a process when block producers are voting for each other in order to remain in power and keep their passive income - according to some estimations, top three EOS BPs earn around 1000 EOS per day.

Eosone implied that chief EOS BPs, including Huobi, which is bthe fourth largest BP in current producer ranking, according to EOS Titan data, were involved in mutual voting along with pay-offs.

Moreover, Huobi allegedly voted for three other BPs in exchange for significant paybacks:

“Huobi votes for eosiosg11111, cochainworld, and eospaceioeos in exchange for 170, 150, and 50 percent of the returns respectively...”

Maple Leaf Capital also argued that such agreements could "increasingly compromise the integrity of the network," noting that at least 12 of 21 major BPs were controlled by Chinese entities:

"This file documents the collusion, mutual voting, and pay-offs that occur amongst the Chinese BP community."

Furthermore, the Twitter user linked the alleged mutual voting with the recent promotion of Huobi Pool Token (HPT,) which shared tokens with users in exchange for locking their EOS on Huobi.

EOS Alliance, an non-profit organization formed by EOS community members and block producers with the role to “facilitate the dialogue within community”, has released a statement on the situation:

“Dan Larimer’s Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS) was designed with the requirement that 15 of 21 independent votes are required to operate the network securely.
