United States cryptocurrency exchange Kraken has hired the ex CEO of over-the-counter (OTC) trading platform B2C2 to head its new Bitcoin futures operation.

Kevin Beardsley, who previously led the United Kingdom-based company for a year, will now oversee Kraken Futuresâ€™ expansion as volumes hit $2.5 billion in June.

Beardsley confirmed the news linking to comments he made to cryptocurrency news outlet The Block.

Kraken acquired its futures operation earlier this year.

Formerly known as Crypto Facilities, the operation is still based in London.

Going forward, the exchange, which raised $13 million in funding last month, will compete with an increasing variety of futures options for cryptocurrency, several of which are surfacing from other trading platforms such as Binance and Huobi.

2019 is set to see multiple launches, with Bakkt, the institutional-grade crypto trading ecosystem, beginning testing of its futures product this week.
