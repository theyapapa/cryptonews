Governor of New Jersey Phil Murphy recently signed bill S2297, which is an act to create a so-dubbed New Jersey Blockchain Initiative Task Force.

The purpose of the task force is purportedly to study blockchain solutions for the benefit of the state.

The news that Murphy passed this bill comes by way of an announcement on the official site of the state of New Jersey on Aug. 8.

According to the press release, the taskforce will study the risks and rewards related to blockchain and distributed ledger technology; public blockchains, private blockchains and consensus algorithms; current projects and use cases around the world and their potential within the state; and what laws could be changed for secure and paperless recordkeeping.

The task force will be headed by the states Chief Technology Officer Chris Rein.

Rein remarked that he was “excited to evaluate and help shape how our state government can best use, and optimize, blockchain technology.”
