Princess Eugenie of the United Kingdom and United States anti-human trafficking Ambassador John Richmond recently spoke in favor of using new technology like phone apps and blockchain to address human trafficking, Reuters reports on April 8.

Eugenie, who founded the Anti-Slavery Collective in Britain in 2017, said:

“I have learned about how blockchain is having a huge impact on supply chain management, and how an app in Britain can help the public report modern slavery at car washes.”

Eugenie was referring to an initiative by Coca Cola and the U.S. Department of State, and the Safe Car Wash App.

The former began in March 2018, and aims to use blockchain technology to create a secure worker registry.

The Safe Car Wash App recently found nearly 1,000 cases of slave labor at car washes in the U.K.

The app was launched by the Church of England and the Catholic Church in England and Wales last June, and allows users to enter their location and enter various indicators of the presence of slave labor, such as whether the establishment only accepts cash, or workers seem fearful.

Anti-human trafficking Ambassador Richmond noted that technology itself cannot stop human trafficking, saying, “There is not an algorithm or app that is going to stop human trafficking.”
