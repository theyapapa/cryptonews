The Canadian House Finance Committee has recommended that the government start regulating cryptocurrencies to prevent money laundering, Canadian digital newspaper iPolitics reports Nov. 14.

According to iPolitics, the Canadian House Finance Committee suggested that cryptocurrencies should be regulated during its review of the Proceeds of Crime Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Act (PCMLTFA), which occurs once every five year.

The first recommendation is to control the exchange from fiat to cryptocurrency, defining the entity conducting the exchange as a money-service business.

This recommendation is in line with the draft of new cryptocurrency regulation released in Canada on June 9.

The new regulation contained in the draft defines cryptocurrency exchanges and payment processors as money-service businesses.

The committee’s second recommendation of the committee, as reported by iPolitics, is for the government to require a license from cryptocurrency exchanges similar to New York’s BitLicense.

The article cites suggestions by financial adviser IJW & Co. and law firm Durand Morisseau LLP contained the witness-testimonials part of the report, which refer to the possibilities for dubious crypto transactions in the current unregulated environment:

“Cryptocurrency transactions may be used by parties to swiftly move large amounts of wealth across borders, and that regulating (exchanges of fiat currencies for cryptocurrencies) would address the (anti-money-laundering) concerns of the cryptocurrency space.”
