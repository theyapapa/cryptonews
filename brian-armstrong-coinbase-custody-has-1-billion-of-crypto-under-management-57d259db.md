During an on-stage discussion at Consensus, Brian Armstrong, CEO of major United States cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, said that its custody service has already received $1 billion in crypto under management.

In response, the Coinbase CEO provided an example of his own company, noting that Coinbase Custody managed to get $1 billion in assets under management in just 12 months after its launch.

Moreover, Armstrong believes that investments in the sphere will grow rapidly, as institutions want their funds to be active while in custody.

The Coinbase CEO stated that institutions want their funds to stake, vote and do governance on-chain.

However, the interest in other coins is growing too, which is why Coinbase currently provides 30 altcoins for institutions, he noted.

Finally, Armstrong mentioned that Coinbase Pro — an upgraded trading platform for advanced users — currently has more than 60% of its trading volume coming from institutions.

As Cointelegraph previously reported, Coinbase officially launched its custody for institutional investors last July.
