# UK Financial Regulator Releases Consultation Paper on Crypto ...

###### 2019-01-23 09:01

The stated goal of the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) paper on cryptocurrency is to provide more regulatory clarity on the subject for market participants.

The consultation period on crypto, which the paper initiates, is scheduled to end on April 5, 2019, after which a policy statement with final guidance is set to be released.

In its introduction to the paper, the FCA declares that the final version is meant to “help market participants to understand whether the cryptoassets they use are within the regulatory perimeter.”

In the paper, the FCA outlines various possible definitions of crypto assets and applicable U.K. laws.

In particular, the guidance paper notes that crypto assets could be considered “Specified Investments” under the state’s Regulated Activities Order (RAO) or “Financial Instruments” regulated by the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II.

The FCA’s crypto asset guidance places cryptocurrencies into three potential categories, namely exchange tokens, security tokens and utility tokens.

Security tokens, on the other hand, are assets that likely fall under RAO and are “within the perimeter” of FCA’s regulations.
