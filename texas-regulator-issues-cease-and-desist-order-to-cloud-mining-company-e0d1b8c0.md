# Texas Regulator Issues Cease and Desist Order to Cloud Mining Company ...

The Texas State Securities Board has issued an emergency cease and desist order to an Australia-based cloud mining company AWS Mining PTY LTD for selling unregistered securities, according to an official notice filed Nov. 6.

Per the document, AWS Mining along with its multiple agents and Chief Marketing Officer Josiah Kostek have violated the Texas Securities Act by luring the state’s residents in purchasing AWS’ unregistered cloud mining power contracts and promising a “200 percent passive return on every investment.”

AWS failed to register as a securities broker-dealer, and moreover, crypto mining power contracts have not been registered and qualified for sale in Texas.

The firm purportedly required investors to secure a digital currency wallet provided by MyCoinDeal to participate in AWS’ crypto mining program, wherein the wallet developers required investors to pay fees for deployment of their wallets and conduct transactions within it.

According to the order, the defendants intentionally failed to disclose that AWS Mining PTY is the business name holder of MyCoinDeal.

The defendants allegedly did not disclose their business data and qualifications, such as their background in selling securities to investors and dealing with cryptocurrencies, nor the commissions they would receive for selling crypto mining power contracts.

Previously, the Texas State Securities Board issued an emergency cease and desist order to a network of cryptocurrency-related firms, that allegedly offered fraudulent crypto investments to state residents.
