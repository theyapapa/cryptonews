A Hong Kong-based entrepreneur has been accused of duping numerous investors in a cryptocurrency mining hardware investment scheme.

A police spokesman is further cited by SCMP as reporting that 9 individuals, aged 29-41, had previously lodged complaints with the authorities claiming they had been cheated of a combined HK$940,000 ($120,000) in investments in Wong’s cryptocurrency business.

Wong is accused of having misled investors into purchasing mining hardware for a crypto token dubbed “Filecoin,” allegedly promising his clients profits on their investments within three months.

Filecoin, however, was reportedly not yet tradeable, and investors allege that Wong’s promises to refund their investments have not been honored.

Ramon Yuen Hoi-man, deputy spokesman for the Democratic Party’s financial policy panel, is reportedly helping the affected investors and told SCMP and local police he had subsequently received a “threatening” phone call — which, however, reportedly did not explicitly mention Wong.

Wong has not yet been charged but will reportedly face an “all-round” police probe into his activities, which include possible money laundering, according to an unnamed police source cited by SCMP.

According to SCMP, Wong is also believed to be the figure behind a stunt in Hong Kong’s Sham Shui Po this December, in which stacks of banknotes worth about HK$6,000 were allegedly thrown from a high-rise.
