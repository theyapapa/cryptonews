American asset management firm Franklin Templeton Investments has filed a preliminary prospectus with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a government money market fund with a focus on blockchain-based shares.

According to a Sept. 3 SEC filing, Franklin Templeton’s fund will make investments in a range of products such as U.S. government securities, repurchase agreements, and blockchain-based shares.

## Stellar network-recorded shares

Franklin Templeton has chosen the Stellar network to record the ownership of the fund’s shares.

The fund’s investment manager ostensibly believes that blockchain-based shares will boost transparency and reduce settlement times, among other benefits to shareholders.

The document further explains that clients will be able to buy and redeem shares of the fund through a special app, where each investor will receive a blockchain wallet and a corresponding pair of public and private keys after an account is created.

It is said that the fund will invest at least 99.5% of its total assets in government securities, cash and repurchase agreements, all collateralized fully by government securities or cash.

The deployment of Stellar protocol will purportedly allow IBM Blockchain World Wire to serve as a network provider for international payments.
