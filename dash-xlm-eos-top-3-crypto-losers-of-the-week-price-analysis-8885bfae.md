# DASH, XLM, EOS: Top-3 Crypto Losers of the Week â€” Price Analysis ...

###### 2019-08-03 20:08

There is a minor support at $86.3249, below which the digital currency will complete a 100% retracement of the rally and fall to $58.49, the level from where the up move had started.

If the price breaks out of the downtrend line and 20-day EMA, it will indicate strength but the pair will start a new uptrend after it breaks out of $120.8464.

A break down to new yearly lows will be a huge negative as it will trigger many stop losses.

However, for the past seven days, the price has remained stuck in a tight range, which suggests that both bulls and bears are not waging a large bet as they are not clear of the next direction.

However, in a strong uptrend, the pullback usually gets arrested between 38.20% and 50% Fibonacci retracement levels of the rally.

The EOS/USD pair declined close to 78.60% Fibonacci retracement level of the rally on July 16.

A breakout and close (UTC time frame) above the channel can be purchased as it increases the probability of the start of a new uptrend that can carry the price to $6 and above it to $7.64.
