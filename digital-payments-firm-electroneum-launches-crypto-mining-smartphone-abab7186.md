Priced at only $80, Electroneum’s M1 phone allows users to mine ETD through an app directly from their devices, with cryptocurrency mining reportedly available in offline mode.

The mined cryptocurrency can be used as payment for shopping, online services as well as mobile data upgrades, the press release notes.
